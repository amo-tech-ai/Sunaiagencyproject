**Date:** 2026-03-07
**Status:** Active
**Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 6 + Supabase + Tailwind CSS v4

---

## 1. Product Vision

Sun AI Agency is a premium, wizard-first AI consulting platform that guides businesses through structured discovery into actionable projects. The product behaves like a digital consultant — observant, structured, transparent, and human-controlled.

**Core flow:** Wizard onboarding (5 screens) -> Executive brief -> Project dashboard -> Ongoing delivery

**Philosophy:** Structure first. Intelligence second. Automation last.

**Core principle:** AI proposes, human decides. Never surprise the user. Never auto-commit changes. Always explain reasoning. Always show previews.

---

## 2. Target Users

### Client (Business User)

**Profile:** Owner, CEO, or operations lead at a service business (50-500 employees).
**Pain:** Know AI matters but don't know where to start. Lack technical expertise. Overwhelmed by options.
**Goal:** Turn an unclear business idea into a structured AI strategy and funded project.
**Journey:** Marketing site -> Signup -> 5-step wizard (~10 min) -> Approve brief -> Track project via dashboard.

### Agency User (Consultant / Owner)

**Profile:** AI consultant or agency owner delivering transformation services to multiple clients.
**Pain:** Need tools to deliver services at scale. Manual client management. No structured discovery process.
**Goal:** Manage client relationships, deliver projects on time, grow revenue.
**Journey:** Morning KPI check -> Pipeline management -> Project delivery -> Task execution -> Analytics review.

### Guest User (Anonymous)

**Profile:** Curious visitor exploring the wizard without commitment.
**Pain:** Doesn't want to create an account just to see the value.
**Goal:** Complete the wizard in guest mode, see results, then decide to sign up.
**Journey:** Landing page -> "Begin Diagnostics" -> Wizard in guest mode (localStorage) -> Sign up to persist.

### 6.3 Wizard (5 Steps)

#### Step 1 — Business Context (`/app/wizard/step-1`)

**Purpose:** Collect company information and trigger AI analysis of their business.

**Center panel — 7 fields:**

| Field | Type | Validation |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Company Name | Text input | Required, 2-100 chars |
| Website URL | URL input | Optional, valid URL format |
| Industry | Dropdown (8 options) | Required |
| Company Size | Dropdown (5 ranges) | Required |
| Primary Goals | Multi-select chips (6 options) | Required, 1-3 selections |
| Timeline | Dropdown (4 options) | Required |
| Budget Range | Dropdown (5 ranges) | Required |

**AI behavior — triggered on URL blur:**
- `analyze-business` Edge Function fires with URL Context + Google Search
- URL Context reads full website content (HTML, PDF, images up to 34MB)
- Google Search discovers market context, competitors, industry trends
- Results cached in `ai_cache` table
- Right panel updates: static guidance -> "Analyzing..." skeleton -> Company Analysis card (industry, services, market position, competitors)

**Fallback chain:** URL Context fails -> Google Search only -> static guidance

**Left panel:** Context card showing saved field values (company name, industry, size)
**Right panel:** Before analysis = static guidance ("What to expect"). After analysis = Company Analysis card.

**Auto-save:** 500ms debounce -> UPSERT to `wizard_answers.data` (JSONB). Save indicator: "Saving..." then "Saved".
**Continue:** Enabled when all required fields valid.

#### Step 2 — Industry Diagnostics (`/app/wizard/step-2`)

**Purpose:** Ask industry-specific diagnostic questions and detect business signals.

**Center panel:** 8 questions loaded from industry pack based on Step 1 industry selection. Question types: single-select, multi-select, slider, text area. Each question has an "explain why" tooltip.

**AI behavior:**
- `generate-diagnostics` Edge Function generates questions from industry pack
- `extractor` agent identifies pain points and opportunity signals from answers
- Signal detection runs in real-time as user answers

**Left panel:** Detected signals badge list (e.g., "Manual CRM", "No automation", "Growth bottleneck")
**Right panel:** Per-question context explaining WHY each question matters for their industry. Updates as user navigates questions.

**On Step 2 completion:** Background `analyze-diagnostics` Edge Function fires (async), caches results in `ai_cache` for Step 3. User proceeds immediately — no blocking.

**Auto-save:** Same 500ms debounce pattern. All answers persisted.
**Continue:** Enabled when all 8 questions answered.

#### Step 3 — System Recommendations (`/app/wizard/step-3`)

**Purpose:** Present AI-ranked system recommendations. User selects 1-5 systems.

**Center panel:** Recommendation cards (3-5 cards), each showing:
- System name and icon
- Priority rank (1-5)
- "Why it fits" — 3 personalized bullets based on diagnostic answers
- Estimated impact (High / Medium / Low)
- Investment tier indicator
- Selection toggle (checkbox or card highlight)
- Optional notes field per system

**AI behavior:**
- `recommend-systems` Edge Function (Pro model, Thinking Mode high)
- Loads from `ai_cache` (populated by Step 2 completion) or runs synchronously if cache miss
- `optimizer` agent refines cost/effort scoring

**Left panel:** Selection count, total estimated investment, selected system names
**Right panel:** Live summary updating as user selects/deselects — shows selection count, combined impact assessment, investment tier summary, complementarity analysis

**Auto-save:** Selections saved as they change.
**Continue:** Enabled when 1-5 systems selected.

#### Step 4 — Executive Brief (`/app/wizard/step-4`)

**Purpose:** AI generates a comprehensive executive brief. User reviews, edits, and approves.

**Center panel:** Document-style view with sections:
- Executive Summary
- Business Analysis (from Step 1 data + AI research)
- Diagnostic Findings (from Step 2 signals)
- Recommended Systems (from Step 3 selections)
- Implementation Roadmap (3-phase, 12-18 month plan)
- Expected Outcomes & ROI projections
- Readiness Score (0-100, with breakdown)

Each section is inline-editable. Version history tracked in `brief_versions` table.

**AI behavior — 3 agents generate the brief:**

| Agent | Model | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `scorer` | Pro (Thinking high) | Readiness score (0-100) with dimension breakdown |
| `summary` | Pro (Thinking high) | Executive narrative across all sections |
| `generate-roadmap` | Pro (Thinking high) | 3-phase roadmap with milestones, tasks, KPIs |

**Brief approval flow:**
1. AI generates brief (status: `draft`, version: 1)
2. User reviews each section
3. User can inline-edit any section -> creates new version snapshot
4. User clicks "Request Changes" -> status: `in_review`
5. User clicks "Approve Brief" -> status: `approved`, Continue enabled
6. On continue -> project creation begins at Step 5

**Left panel:** Brief status indicator, version number, section completion checkmarks
**Right panel:** AI reasoning for each section — why this score, why this recommendation, data sources used

**Continue:** Enabled only when brief status = `approved`.

#### Step 5 — Launch Project (`/app/wizard/step-5`)

**Purpose:** Create the project from approved brief and transition to dashboard.

**Layout:** Centered single-column (no three-panel), max-width 800px.

**Center panel:** Project summary card showing:
- Company name and industry
- Selected systems (from Step 3)
- Readiness score (from Step 4)
- Roadmap overview (3 phases with names and durations)
- Staggered checklist animation showing creation progress:
  - Creating project...
  - Saving context snapshot...
  - Building roadmap...
  - Generating tasks...
  - Setting up services...
- "Enter Your Dashboard" CTA (enabled after all items complete)

**AI behavior:**
- `task-generator` Edge Function creates 12 initial tasks (3-5 per phase)
- Tasks are contextually relevant to selected systems and industry

**Data created on Step 5:**
- `projects` row (status, phase, progress)
- `context_snapshots` row (versioned wizard data)
- `roadmaps` row (duration, ROI projection)
- `roadmap_phases` rows (3 phases)
- `tasks` rows (12 AI-generated tasks)
- `project_systems` rows (selected systems)
- `project_services` rows (system-to-service mappings)

| Industry packs | ~75% (6/8 complete) |

### 15.3 Not Started

| Feature | Priority |
|---------|----------|
| Auth screens (login, signup, OAuth) | P0 |
| Agency dashboard | P1 |
| Chatbot system (widget + Cmd+K) | P2 |
| Revenue/billing (Stripe) | P2 |
| RAG/knowledge base | P3 |
| Mobile optimization | P3 |
| Testing infrastructure | P3 |

### 15.4 Build Order (Critical Path)

```
Infrastructure (001-004) -> Auth (005-007) -> Wizard Shell (008)
    -> Steps 1-5 (009-014) -> Client Dashboard (017-023)
        -> Agency Dashboard (024-028)
```

Parallel tracks:
- Industry Packs (015-016) — needs DB only
- Services Catalog (037-040) — needs DB only
- Chatbot (034-036) — needs Edge Functions only
- Revenue (041-043) — needs Stripe setup

## 17. Risks

### Technical

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Gemini API rate limits or downtime | Medium | Caching (`ai_cache`), retry with exponential backoff, fallback responses |
| Edge Function cold starts | Low | Keep-alive, function warming, caching |
| Database performance at scale | Medium | Index optimization, read replicas, query tuning |
| Model deprecation | High | Pin to current models, monitor notices, skill files track model IDs |

### Product

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| AI recommendations not relevant | High | Industry packs, user feedback loops, A/B testing prompts |
| Wizard too complex | Medium | 5-step limit, progress indicators, auto-save, guest mode |
| Low conversion wizard to paid | High | Clear value in Step 3-4 (personalized recommendations + brief) |

### Business

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Low adoption | High | Content marketing, referral program, free wizard trial |
| High customer acquisition cost | Medium | SEO, partnerships, word-of-mouth from wizard value |
| Competition | Medium | Industry specialization, superior wizard UX, end-to-end workflow |
