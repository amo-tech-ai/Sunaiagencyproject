## Description

**Situation.** The agency runs dozens of repetitive operational tasks every week — creating projects after wizard completions, moving CRM deals forward, notifying consultants about milestones, generating weekly reports. Every one of these tasks involves the same sequence: an event happens, a condition is checked, and an action is taken. Today each of these is performed manually, creating delay, inconsistency, and forgotten follow-ups.

**Why it matters.** A growing agency cannot scale on manual processes. Every missed notification is a delayed onboarding. Every forgotten milestone email is a client wondering what happened. Workflow automation turns the agency's data (wizard outputs, CRM changes, milestone dates) into a self-running operational engine. The difference between a 5-person agency and a 50-person one is the automation layer.

**What exists.** The database already captures the events that should trigger workflows: `wizard_sessions.completed_at`, `crm_deals` stage changes, `milestones.due_date`, `activities` logs. What is missing is the automation layer that connects these triggers to actions, and a visual interface for building, monitoring, and debugging those connections.

**The build.** A dashboard with three zones: (1) an active workflows list showing all configured automations with their status, last run, and success rate; (2) a workflow builder allowing trigger-condition-action chain construction from pre-built blocks; (3) an execution log showing every run with success/failure details and duration. Pre-built templates cover the most common patterns: post-wizard project setup, deal stage notifications, milestone alerts, and weekly reporting.

**Example.** A client completes the wizard at 3:47 PM. The "Wizard Complete -> Project Setup" workflow fires: it reads the wizard_answers, creates a project record, generates roadmap_phases from the Step 5 AI output, creates initial tasks, inserts a CRM deal, and logs an activity. The consultant gets a Slack notification. The entire sequence takes 4 seconds instead of 25 minutes of manual data entry. The operations team sees the green checkmark in the execution log.

## User Stories

- As an **agency owner**, I want to define automated workflows so that repetitive operations happen instantly and consistently without manual intervention.
- As an **operations manager**, I want to see all active workflows and their execution history so I can identify failures and fix them before they impact clients.
- As a **consultant**, I want to receive automated notifications when wizard sessions complete, milestones approach, or deal stages change so I never miss a client touchpoint.
- As an **agency owner**, I want pre-built workflow templates so I can get started quickly without building every automation from scratch.
- As an **operations manager**, I want to test workflows manually before enabling them so I can verify they work correctly.
- As an **agency owner**, I want AI to suggest new workflows based on my usage patterns so I can automate processes I did not think to automate.

---

## Screen Purpose

Visual interface for configuring and monitoring automated workflows that connect wizard outputs to ongoing operations. Workflows like: "When wizard completes -> create project -> create deal -> notify consultant -> schedule onboarding call". Shows active automations, execution logs, and allows building new trigger-to-action chains. This is the operational backbone that transforms a manual agency into an automated one.

---

## Target User

Agency operations team managing day-to-day processes. Agency owner setting up business automations and reviewing execution health. Consultants who benefit from automated notifications and project scaffolding but do not build workflows themselves.

---

## Core Features

1. **Active workflows list** — Table showing all configured workflows with name, trigger type, status toggle (enabled/disabled/error), last run time, success rate, total runs, and quick-action buttons (edit, test, delete).
2. **Workflow builder** — Visual trigger -> condition -> action chain editor. Each block is a card with configuration fields. Drag to reorder. Add branches for conditional logic. Blocks snap together vertically.
3. **Execution log** — Per-workflow log showing last 50 runs with timestamp, duration (ms), status badge (success/fail/skipped), trigger data summary, and expandable error details for failures.
4. **Pre-built templates** — Five starter workflows: "Wizard Complete -> Project Setup" (creates project + roadmap + tasks + deal from wizard data), "Deal Stage Change -> Notify" (sends notification on CRM stage transition), "Milestone Due -> Alert" (emails and logs activity 3 days before due), "Weekly Report" (cron aggregation of activities and AI logs), "Lead Qualification" (scores new wizard sessions and routes to appropriate consultant).
5. **Workflow metrics** — Top-level stats: runs today, overall success rate, average execution time, active workflows count. Displayed in a 4-card metrics row.
6. **Manual trigger and testing** — "Run Now" button per workflow that executes immediately with optional dry-run mode showing what would happen without committing changes.

**Built-in workflow template details:**

- **Wizard Complete -> Project Setup**: Trigger: `wizard_sessions.completed_at IS NOT NULL`. Actions: insert into `projects`, generate `roadmap_phases` from Step 5 AI output, create initial `tasks`, insert `crm_deals` with value from investment tier, log to `activities`.
- **Deal Stage Change -> Notify**: Trigger: `crm_deals.stage_id` update. Condition: new stage differs from old. Actions: send notification to deal owner, log interaction in `crm_interactions`.
- **Milestone Due -> Alert**: Trigger: cron daily 9am. Condition: `milestones.due_date` within 3 days. Actions: email project owner, insert `activities` record.
- **Weekly Report**: Trigger: cron Sunday 9am. Actions: aggregate `activities` count by type, aggregate `ai_run_logs` by agent, count new `wizard_sessions`, sum `payments` received, generate summary, deliver via email/notification.
- **Lead Qualification**: Trigger: new `wizard_sessions` row inserted. Actions: score based on Step 1 answers (company size, revenue), route high-value leads to senior consultant, log to `activities`.

## Data Displayed

- **Workflow list**: Name, trigger type icon, status badge, last run (relative time), success rate (%), total runs count, created date
- **Execution log**: Run ID, timestamp, duration (ms), status (success/fail/skipped), trigger event summary, action results summary, error message (if failed)
- **Metrics row**: Runs today (number + trend), success rate (percentage + trend), avg execution time (ms), active workflows (count / total)
- **Template gallery**: Template name, description, trigger type, number of actions, estimated setup time, "Install" button
- **Builder blocks**: Trigger block (event type, source table, field conditions), condition block (field, operator, value), action block (action type, target table, field mappings)

## Interaction Patterns

- **Toggle workflow**: Click enable/disable switch -> confirmation dialog -> status updates in real time
- **Edit workflow**: Click edit button -> workflow builder opens below with existing blocks loaded
- **Install template**: Click "Install" on template card -> pre-populated builder opens for review -> "Save & Enable" to activate
- **Manual test**: Click "Run Now" -> optional dry-run checkbox -> execution runs -> result toast notification
- **View execution details**: Click log row -> expands to show full trigger data, each action's result, and error stack trace if failed
- **Natural language input**: Type sentence -> AI parses into blocks -> blocks appear in builder for review -> user adjusts and saves
- **AI suggestion**: Panel shows suggested workflow -> click "Create" -> builder opens with suggested blocks pre-loaded

---

## Example User Workflows

**Workflow 1: Setting up post-wizard automation**
1. Agency owner opens Workflow Automation dashboard
2. Clicks "Templates" tab
3. Finds "Wizard Complete -> Project Setup" template
4. Clicks "Install" -> builder opens with pre-configured blocks
5. Reviews trigger (wizard completed), actions (create project, create roadmap phases, create deal)
6. Adjusts the deal value mapping to use investment_tier from Step 3
7. Clicks "Save & Enable"
8. Tests with "Run Now" using a completed wizard session
9. Sees green success in execution log

**Workflow 2: Debugging a failed workflow**
1. Operations manager sees red error badge on "Milestone Due -> Alert" workflow
2. Clicks "Execution Log" tab, filters to that workflow
3. Sees last 3 runs failed
4. Expands failed row -> error: "Email service timeout"
5. Checks the action configuration, updates email provider settings
6. Clicks "Retry" on the failed run -> success
7. Re-enables the workflow

**Workflow 3: AI-suggested workflow**
1. Owner opens "AI Suggestions" tab
2. AI has detected that every time a deal moves to "Proposal Sent", the owner manually creates a document
3. Suggestion: "Auto-generate proposal document when deal reaches Proposal Sent stage"
4. Owner clicks "Create" -> builder opens with trigger (deal stage = Proposal Sent) and action (generate document from wizard data)
5. Owner saves and enables

---

## AI Features

1. **Workflow suggestions** — Analyzes the `activities` table for repeated manual action sequences and proposes automations that would replace them. Surfaces in the AI Suggestions tab with confidence scores.
2. **Natural language creation** — Text input accepts plain English like "notify me when any deal is stale for 7 days" and parses it into a trigger (cron daily), condition (deal last_updated > 7 days ago), action (send notification) chain.
3. **Auto-fix failed workflows** — When a workflow fails, AI analyzes the error and suggests a fix (e.g., "The email action timed out. Consider adding a retry with 30s delay.").
4. **Execution optimization** — AI identifies workflows that could be batched or reordered for efficiency.

## Data Sources

| Source Table       | Data Used                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `activities`       | All platform events, used for AI pattern detection and logging   |
| `projects`         | Created by workflows, used as action targets                     |
| `tasks`            | Created as part of project setup workflows                       |
| `wizard_sessions`  | Trigger source for wizard completion events                      |
| `ai_run_logs`      | Execution history for all workflow runs                          |
| `clients`          | Referenced in workflow actions (project/deal creation)           |
| `crm_deals`        | Trigger source for stage changes, action target for deal creation|
| `milestones`       | Trigger source for approaching due dates                         |
| `roadmap_phases`   | Created by post-wizard workflows from Step 5 AI output           |

---

## Automation Opportunities

- **Self-healing workflows**: When a workflow fails due to a transient error (timeout, rate limit), automatically retry with exponential backoff before marking as failed.
- **Workflow chaining**: Output of one workflow triggers another (e.g., "Project Created" from workflow A triggers "Assign Consultant" workflow B).
- **Scheduled digest**: Instead of individual notifications, batch workflow results into a daily digest email for the operations team.
- **Version control**: Track workflow definition changes over time so configurations can be rolled back.
- **Usage-based archival**: Auto-disable workflows that have not run in 30 days with a notification to the owner.

---

## Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary focus**: Metrics row at top — immediate operational health at a glance (runs today, success rate)
2. **Secondary focus**: Active workflows list — the main working area where users manage their automations
3. **Tertiary focus**: Execution log — drill-down detail for debugging and verification
4. **Supporting elements**: Template gallery and AI suggestions — discovery and expansion of automation coverage
5. **Typography**: Playfair Display for "Workflow Automation" page heading and section titles, Lora for all body text, descriptions, and log entries
6. **Color coding**: #84CC16 for success states and enabled toggles, #0A211F for primary text, red (#DC2626) for error states, #D4CFC8 for borders and dividers
7. **Density**: Medium density — workflows need enough detail to be useful at a glance but not so much that the list becomes overwhelming

### State Management

| State | Location | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Active tab | `WorkflowAutomationPage` useState (synced to URL hash) | Persists tab on refresh |
| Workflow list | `useWorkflows` hook (useState) | Fetched on mount, refetched after save/toggle |
| Builder open/closed | `WorkflowAutomationPage` useState | Controls builder panel visibility |
| Builder workflow state | `useWorkflowBuilder` hook (useReducer) | Complex nested state with trigger/conditions/actions |
| Selected workflow for editing | `WorkflowAutomationPage` useState (id or null) | Passed to builder hook |
| Execution log filter (by workflow) | `ExecutionLog` local useState | Filter execution list |
| Dry-run checkbox | `ManualTriggerButton` local useState | Toggle for test mode |
| NL input text | `NaturalLanguageInput` local useState | Controlled input |
| Drag state for builder blocks | `WorkflowBuilder` local useState (drag source/target) | Reorder actions |

### Data Fetching Pattern

```
WorkflowAutomationPage mounts
  → useWorkflows()
      → api<Workflow[]>('/dashboard/workflows', { method: 'GET' })

  → useWorkflowMetrics()
      → api<WorkflowMetrics>('/dashboard/workflows/metrics', { method: 'GET' })

  Tab: "log" active
    → useWorkflowExecutions(workflowId?)
        → api<WorkflowExecution[]>('/dashboard/workflows/executions', { method: 'POST', body: { workflow_id } })

  Tab: "suggestions" active
    → useAISuggestions()
        → api<AISuggestion[]>('/dashboard/workflows/suggestions', { method: 'GET' })

  Toggle workflow enabled/disabled
    → api('/dashboard/workflows/toggle', { method: 'POST', body: { id, enabled } })
    → refetch workflows

  Save workflow (new or edit)
    → api('/dashboard/workflows', { method: 'POST', body: workflow })
    → refetch workflows

  "Run Now" button
    → api<WorkflowExecution>('/dashboard/workflows/run', { method: 'POST', body: { workflow_id, dry_run } })

  NL input submit
    → api<Partial<Workflow>>('/dashboard/workflows/parse-nl', { method: 'POST', body: { input } })
    → populate builder with parsed blocks
```

### Component Communication

- **Props down**: `WorkflowAutomationPage` passes `workflows` to `WorkflowList`, `metrics` to `WorkflowMetricsRow`, `templates` (hardcoded constant) to `TemplateGallery`
- **Callbacks up**: `WorkflowRow` fires `onToggle(id, enabled)` and `onEdit(id)` and `onDelete(id)`; `TemplateCard` fires `onInstall(template)` which opens builder with pre-populated data; `SuggestionCard` fires `onCreate(suggestion)` which opens builder
- **Builder panel**: `WorkflowAutomationPage` holds `builderOpen` and `editingWorkflowId` state; when builder saves, it fires `onSave` which calls `refetch()` and closes builder
- **Execution log filtering**: `ExecutionLog` receives optional `workflowId` prop; when user clicks "View Logs" on a workflow row, the parent switches to log tab with that workflow pre-filtered
- **NL input to builder**: `NaturalLanguageInput` fires `onParsed(partialWorkflow)` which loads the parsed trigger/conditions/actions into the builder via `useWorkflowBuilder`

## Backend Wiring

### New Edge Function Routes

| Method | Route | Handler | Request Body | Response Shape |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| GET | `/dashboard/workflows` | List all workflow definitions | — | `Workflow[]` |
| POST | `/dashboard/workflows` | Create or update a workflow | `Partial<Workflow>` (full definition) | `{ id: string, created: boolean }` |
| DELETE | `/dashboard/workflows/:id` | Delete a workflow | — | `{ success: boolean }` |
| POST | `/dashboard/workflows/toggle` | Enable or disable a workflow | `{ id: string, enabled: boolean }` | `{ success: boolean }` |
| GET | `/dashboard/workflows/metrics` | Aggregate workflow execution metrics | — | `WorkflowMetrics` |
| POST | `/dashboard/workflows/executions` | List executions, optionally filtered | `{ workflow_id?: string, limit?: number }` | `WorkflowExecution[]` |
| POST | `/dashboard/workflows/run` | Execute a workflow immediately | `{ workflow_id: string, dry_run: boolean }` | `WorkflowExecution` |
| POST | `/dashboard/workflows/retry` | Retry a failed execution | `{ execution_id: string }` | `WorkflowExecution` |
| GET | `/dashboard/workflows/suggestions` | AI-generated workflow suggestions | — | `AISuggestion[]` |
| POST | `/dashboard/workflows/parse-nl` | Parse natural language into blocks | `{ input: string }` | `Partial<Workflow>` |

### Supabase Client Queries

```ts
// Load all workflow definitions (from a workflows table or JSON config)
// If using a new `workflows` table:
const { data: workflows } = await db
  .from('workflows')
  .select('*')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

// Load execution history from ai_run_logs (workflow executions tagged via context)
const { data: executions } = await db
  .from('ai_run_logs')
  .select('*')
  .not('context->workflow_id', 'is', null)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(50);

// If filtering by specific workflow:
const { data: executions } = await db
  .from('ai_run_logs')
  .select('*')
  .eq('context->>workflow_id', workflowId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(50);

// Workflow metrics: aggregate today's runs
const todayStart = new Date(); todayStart.setHours(0,0,0,0);
const { data: todayRuns } = await db
  .from('ai_run_logs')
  .select('success, duration_ms')
  .not('context->workflow_id', 'is', null)
  .gte('created_at', todayStart.toISOString());

// Wizard completion trigger check (polling or realtime)
const { data: completedSessions } = await db
  .from('wizard_sessions')
  .select('id, org_id, completed_at')
  .not('completed_at', 'is', null)
  .eq('processed', false)
  .order('completed_at', { ascending: true });

// Deal stage change trigger (recent changes)
const { data: recentDealChanges } = await db
  .from('crm_deals')
  .select('id, title, stage_id, updated_at, client_id')
  .gte('updated_at', sinceTimestamp)
  .order('updated_at', { ascending: false });

// Milestone approaching trigger
const { data: upcomingMilestones } = await db
  .from('milestones')
  .select('id, name, due_date, project_id')
  .gte('due_date', new Date().toISOString())
  .lte('due_date', threeDaysFromNow.toISOString());

// Execute action: create project
await db.from('projects').insert({
  name: projectName,
  client_id: clientId,
  status: 'active',
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
});

// Execute action: log activity
await db.from('activities').insert({
  type: 'workflow_execution',
  description: `Workflow "${workflowName}" executed successfully`,
  entity_type: 'workflow',
  entity_id: workflowId,
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
});

// AI suggestions: find repeated manual patterns
const { data: recentActivities } = await db
  .from('activities')
  .select('type, description, entity_type, created_at')
  .gte('created_at', thirtyDaysAgo)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(500);
```

### RLS Policies Needed

| Table | Policy | Rule |
|-------|--------|------|
| `workflows` (new table) | SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE for agency admins | `auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM org_members WHERE role IN ('admin', 'owner'))` |
| `ai_run_logs` | SELECT for agency members (workflow execution history) | `auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM org_members WHERE org_id = ai_run_logs.org_id)` |
| `activities` | INSERT for workflow engine (via adminClient) | Workflows insert via `adminClient()` which bypasses RLS |
| `projects` | INSERT for workflow engine (via adminClient) | Workflows create via `adminClient()` |
| `crm_deals` | SELECT for trigger detection, INSERT for deal creation | Agency members can read; `adminClient()` for inserts from workflows |
| `wizard_sessions` | SELECT for trigger detection | Agency members can read sessions for their org |
| `milestones` | SELECT for trigger detection | Agency members can read milestones for their projects |

### API Response Interfaces

```ts
// GET /dashboard/workflows response
type WorkflowListResponse = Workflow[];

// POST /dashboard/workflows response
interface WorkflowSaveResponse {
  id: string;
  created: boolean;                            // true if new, false if updated
}

// GET /dashboard/workflows/metrics response
interface WorkflowMetricsResponse {
  runs_today: number;
  runs_today_trend: number;
  success_rate: number;
  success_rate_trend: number;
  avg_execution_ms: number;
  active_count: number;
  total_count: number;
}

// POST /dashboard/workflows/executions response
type WorkflowExecutionsResponse = WorkflowExecution[];

// POST /dashboard/workflows/run response (also retry)
type WorkflowRunResponse = WorkflowExecution;

// GET /dashboard/workflows/suggestions response
type WorkflowSuggestionsResponse = AISuggestion[];

// POST /dashboard/workflows/parse-nl response
interface NLParseResponse {
  trigger: WorkflowTrigger | null;
  conditions: WorkflowCondition[];
  actions: WorkflowAction[];
  confidence: number;
  raw_interpretation: string;                  // human-readable parse explanation
}
```

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| No workflows configured | Empty state: "No workflows yet. Start with a template or create your own." with link to templates tab |
| Workflow trigger fires but condition fails | Execution logged as "skipped" with reason: "Condition not met: {field} {operator} {value}" |
| Workflow action fails mid-chain (e.g., 3 actions, 2nd fails) | First action committed, second logged as failed, third skipped; execution status = "failed" with partial results |
| Dry-run execution | All actions simulated — returns what would happen without committing to DB; execution response includes `dry_run: true` flag |
| Cron workflow: no matching data at scheduled time | Execution logged as "skipped" with reason: "No matching records found" |
| NL input cannot be parsed | Response returns `confidence: 0` with `raw_interpretation: "Could not parse input. Try: 'when [event] then [action]'"` |
| Circular workflow trigger (workflow A triggers B triggers A) | Max depth of 3 chained executions enforced; 4th attempt returns error "Maximum workflow chain depth exceeded" |
| Unauthorized user | RLS blocks access; frontend shows "You need admin access to manage workflows" |
| Template already installed | "Install" button changes to "Installed" (disabled); user can still create a new copy via "Duplicate" |
