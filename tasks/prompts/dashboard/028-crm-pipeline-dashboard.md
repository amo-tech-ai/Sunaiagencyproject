## Description

**The situation:** The agency acquires clients through the wizard funnel — prospects start the wizard, and some complete it. The `crm_pipelines`, `crm_stages`, and `crm_deals` tables exist in the schema, but there is no interface to manage the sales pipeline. Deals are not created when wizards complete. There is no visibility into which leads are progressing, stalling, or closing. The agency tracks sales informally through spreadsheets or memory.

**Why it matters:** The wizard generates high-intent leads — someone who completes a readiness assessment and system recommendations is a qualified prospect. Without a pipeline view, the agency cannot track deal progression, forecast revenue, or identify stale deals that need follow-up. The connection between wizard engagement and sales conversion is invisible.

**What already exists:** The `crm_pipelines` table supports multiple named pipelines. The `crm_stages` table has position-ordered stages per pipeline. The `crm_deals` table stores deals with value, probability, contact_id, and stage_id FKs. The `crm_contacts` table holds contact details. The `crm_interactions` table logs calls, emails, and meetings per deal or contact. The `wizard_sessions` table provides wizard completion data that can trigger deal creation. shadcn/ui provides Card, Badge, Dialog, Select, Popover, and Sheet components. The kanban pattern from the project task board (027) can be adapted for deal stages.

**The build:** Create a `CRMPipeline` page at `/app/crm/pipelines` with a horizontal kanban board as the primary view. Each column represents a stage from `crm_stages` (ordered by position). Deal cards show deal title, value, contact name, probability, and days in current stage. Deals are draggable between stages. A pipeline selector (tabs or dropdown) switches between pipelines. Clicking a deal opens a detail panel with the full interaction timeline, contact info, linked wizard data, and deal metadata. A forecast section shows weighted pipeline value by month using Recharts. A conversion funnel chart shows stage-to-stage drop-off rates.

**Example:** Apex Marketing Agency has two pipelines: "New Business" (stages: Lead, Qualified, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost) and "Upsell" (stages: Identified, Pitched, Approved, Delivered). The agency owner opens the CRM pipeline view. "New Business" is selected. The kanban shows: 4 deals in "Lead" ($32K total), 3 in "Qualified" ($28K), 2 in "Proposal Sent" ($18K), 1 in "Negotiation" ($15K). She drags "GreenLeaf Healthcare — AI Patient Scheduling" from "Qualified" to "Proposal Sent", logs an interaction "Sent proposal doc via email", and sets close probability to 60%. The forecast chart at the bottom shows $45K weighted pipeline this month.

---

## Rationale

**Problem:** No sales pipeline visibility. Wizard-generated leads are not tracked through a sales process. Revenue forecasting is impossible.

**Solution:** A kanban-based CRM pipeline with draggable deal cards, interaction logging, and revenue forecasting. Wizard completion auto-creates deals to connect the top of funnel to sales management.

**Impact:** Agency can manage the full sales cycle from wizard lead to closed deal. Revenue forecasting enables planning. Stale deal detection prevents lost opportunities.

---

## Screen Purpose

## Interaction Patterns

- Drag deal cards between stage columns (updates crm_deals.stage_id via Supabase)
- Click deal card -> open detail panel (Sheet) from right
- Pipeline tabs switch the kanban to show that pipeline's stages and deals
- Hover stage header -> tooltip with conversion rate from previous stage
- Click "Add Deal" button (top right or in empty column) -> DealQuickCreate dialog
- In detail panel, click "Log Interaction" -> inline form expands with type select + notes textarea
- Click contact name in deal card -> navigate to contact profile or open popover
- Forecast chart bars are clickable -> filter kanban to deals with expected close in that month
- Stage column header "total value" updates live as deals are dragged in/out

---

## Example User Workflows

**Workflow 1 — Wizard-to-deal conversion:** A prospect completes the wizard. The system auto-creates a deal: title "TechNova Solutions — AI Transformation" in the "Qualified" stage (they completed all 5 steps) with estimated value $22K (derived from 3 selected systems at estimated pricing). The deal card shows readiness score 72 from wizard data. Agency rep opens the deal, reviews the wizard analysis in the "Wizard Data" tab, and prepares a proposal. She logs an interaction "Reviewed wizard analysis, preparing custom proposal based on 3 recommended systems." She drags the deal to "Proposal Sent."

**Workflow 2 — Revenue forecasting:** Agency owner opens the CRM pipeline and scrolls to the forecast chart. March shows $45K weighted pipeline (6 deals, weighted by probability). April shows $38K. She clicks the March bar — the kanban filters to 6 deals expected to close in March. She notices 2 deals in "Negotiation" have been there for 12 days (stale indicator turns amber at 7+ days). She opens each deal and adds follow-up interactions to push toward close.

**Workflow 3 — Stale deal management:** The agency owner notices 3 deals with amber "stale" indicators (7+ days in current stage). She clicks the first deal, "Fresh Bites Group — Cart Recovery" in "Proposal Sent" for 9 days. The interaction timeline shows no activity since the proposal was sent. She logs a note "Follow up: scheduled call for Thursday" and updates the probability from 40% to 30%. The weighted pipeline value adjusts automatically.

---

## AI Features

- Deal scoring based on wizard readiness score + engagement signals (wizard completion rate, login frequency, time spent in wizard) — higher wizard engagement correlates with higher close probability
- Predicted close date based on average deal cycle time per stage and current velocity
- "Stale deal" alerts: highlight deals that have exceeded the average time-in-stage for their current stage
- Next best action per deal: "Send case study for similar industry", "Schedule technical demo", "Offer Phase 1 discount"
- Auto-generate proposal outline from wizard data: business profile, recommended systems, projected ROI, phased timeline
- Win/loss pattern analysis: "Deals with readiness score > 70 close at 3x the rate of those below 50"

## Data Sources (tables)

| Data | Table | Column/Query |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Pipelines | crm_pipelines | select all where org_id = agency org |
| Stages | crm_stages | where pipeline_id, order by position |
| Deals | crm_deals | where stage_id in pipeline's stages, includes value, probability, contact_id |
| Contacts | crm_contacts | join on crm_deals.contact_id |
| Interactions | crm_interactions | where deal_id or contact_id, order by created_at desc |
| Wizard context | wizard_sessions | where org_id = deal's client org, join wizard_answers for ai_results |
| Client link | clients | linked via crm_contacts.client_id or deal metadata |
| Deal history | activities | where entity_type = 'deal' and entity_id = deal.id |
| Forecast data | crm_deals | group by expected_close_month, sum(value * probability) |

---

## Automation Opportunities

- Auto-create deal when wizard session completes (status = 'completed') with value estimated from selected systems
- Auto-set initial stage based on wizard completion depth (Step 1-2 = "Lead", Step 3-4 = "Qualified", Step 5 = "Proposal Ready")
- Auto-move deal to next stage when proposal document is uploaded (via documents table integration)
- Alert on deals stale > 7 days in any stage (no interactions logged)
- Weekly pipeline summary email to agency owner: new deals, stage changes, forecast delta
- Auto-calculate probability based on historical win rates per stage
- Auto-log activity when deal changes stage, value, or probability

---

## Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary focus**: Pipeline kanban board (center, full width, main interaction surface)
2. **Secondary**: Deal cards within columns (scannable, data-dense, draggable)
3. **Tertiary**: Stage headers with deal count and total value (column context)
4. **Supporting**: Forecast chart (below, analytical), Detail panel (right overlay, contextual)

  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  refresh: () => void;

### State Management

| State | Location | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `activePipelineId` | CRMPipeline useState + URL search param `?pipeline=xxx` | Persisted in URL so pipeline selection is shareable |
| `deals` (per pipeline) | useDeals hook (useState) | Fetched when pipeline changes; mutated optimistically on drag |
| `selectedDealId` | CRMPipeline useState | Controls DealDetailPanel Sheet open/close |
| `isCreateDialogOpen` | CRMPipeline useState | Controls DealQuickCreate dialog |
| `dragState` | PipelineBoard local useState (via dnd library) | Active during drag-and-drop only |
| `forecastFilter` | ForecastChart local useState | When a bar is clicked, filters kanban to that month's deals |
| `orgId` | AuthContext | From auth session |
| `interactionForm` | InteractionForm local useState | Type select + notes textarea values |

### Data Fetching Pattern

```
usePipeline(null)  — initial load, fetches all pipelines for tabs
  └── api<{ pipelines: Pipeline[] }>('/dashboard/crm/pipelines', { method: 'POST', body: { orgId } })

usePipeline(pipelineId)  — when pipeline selected, fetches stages + deals
  └── api<PipelineData>('/dashboard/crm/pipelines/:id', {
        method: 'POST', body: { pipelineId }
      })
      ↳ Returns: stages (ordered by position), deals (with contact info),
        forecast (next 6 months), conversion rates

useDealDetail(dealId)
  └── api<DealDetail>('/dashboard/crm/deals/:id', {
        method: 'POST', body: { dealId }
      })
      ↳ Returns: deal with interactions, wizard data (if linked), stage history

useDeals.moveDeal(dealId, stageId)

- Optimistic updates: `moveDeal` immediately moves the card in local state; stage header totals recompute; reverts on error.
- Drag-and-drop: Uses `@dnd-kit/core`. On `onDragEnd`, calls `moveDeal(dealId, destinationStageId)`.
- Forecast recomputation: After any deal move/value change, forecast is recomputed client-side (sum of value * probability grouped by expectedCloseDate month).

### Component Communication

- **Props down**: `CRMPipeline` passes `stages` and `deals` (grouped by stageId) to `PipelineBoard`. `PipelineBoard` passes stage-specific deals to each `StageColumn`. Each `StageColumn` renders `DealCard[]`.
- **Callbacks up**: `DealCard` calls `onDealClick(dealId)` → parent sets `selectedDealId` → opens Sheet. `PipelineBoard` calls `onDealMove(dealId, newStageId)` → parent calls `useDeals.moveDeal()`. `PipelineSelector` calls `onPipelineChange(id)` → parent sets `activePipelineId`.
- **ForecastChart → Board filtering**: `ForecastChart` calls `onBarClick(month)` → parent sets `forecastFilter` → `PipelineBoard` filters deals to show only those with `expectedCloseDate` in that month. Click again to clear.
- **DealDetailPanel**: Receives `dealId`, fetches detail internally with `useDealDetail`. `InteractionForm` calls `logInteraction` → appends to local list + persists.
- **StageColumn totals**: Computed from filtered deals array: `deals.filter(d => d.stageId === stage.id).reduce((sum, d) => sum + d.value, 0)`.

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| No pipelines exist (first-time setup) | Return `pipelines: []`. Frontend shows "Create your first pipeline" CTA with a setup wizard dialog that creates pipeline + default stages (Lead, Qualified, Proposal, Negotiation, Won, Lost) |
| Pipeline has no deals | Stages render with empty columns. Each column shows "+ Add Deal" placeholder card |
| Deal has no contact | `contactName: null`. DealCard shows "No contact" placeholder. Detail panel shows "Add contact" link |
| Deal has no expected close date | `expectedCloseDate: null`. Excluded from forecast chart. DealCard shows "No close date" in gray |
| Drag deal to same column | No-op. `moveDeal` checks if `stageId` changed before making API call |
| Stale deal calculation for newly created deals | `stage_entered_at` set to `created_at`. `daysInStage: 0`. Not stale |
| Wizard session linked but wizard data deleted | `wizardData: null`. Wizard Data tab shows "Wizard data no longer available" message |
| Deal moved to "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost" stage | `closeDeal` handler marks deal as closed. Card removed from board. Logged as activity. Shown in conversion metrics |
| Contact search on DealQuickCreate returns no matches | Show "Create new contact" inline form within the search dropdown |
| Forecast with no deals in future months | Empty bars in chart (value: $0). Show at least 3 future months |
| Large pipeline (50+ deals in one stage) | Column scrolls vertically. No virtualization needed at this scale. Consider "Show top 20" + "Load more" if > 30 per column |
| Unauthorized user | 401 response. Frontend redirects to `/login` |
| Pipeline ID not found | 404 response. Frontend shows "Pipeline not found" with link to `/app/crm/pipelines` |

## Outcomes

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Wizard completions don't create sales pipeline entries | Auto-created deals with wizard context flow into the kanban |
| No visibility into sales pipeline — managed via spreadsheet | Full kanban board with drag-and-drop stage management |
| No interaction history with prospects | Chronological timeline of calls, emails, meetings per deal |
| Revenue forecasting is guesswork | Weighted pipeline forecast chart by month using deal value * probability |
| Stale deals go unnoticed for weeks | Amber indicators flag deals in same stage > 7 days |
