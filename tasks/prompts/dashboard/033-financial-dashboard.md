## Description

**Situation.** The agency sells AI transformation services at investment tiers defined during wizard Step 3. A client selects a tier, the roadmap is generated with phase-level cost estimates, and the engagement begins. From that point forward, money flows: invoices are created at milestones, payments are collected, and the agency needs to track whether each project is profitable and whether the overall business is growing.

**Why it matters.** Revenue is the heartbeat of the agency. Without a financial dashboard, the owner relies on spreadsheets and bank statements to answer basic questions: How much revenue did we collect this month? Which invoices are overdue? Is the Acme Retail project profitable? What is our pipeline value? These questions need instant answers, not 30-minute spreadsheet sessions. A financial dashboard turns raw invoice and payment data into actionable business intelligence.

**What exists.** The database has `invoices` (amount, status, due_date, client_id, project_id), `payments` (amount, invoice_id, payment_date, method), `projects` (with budget derived from roadmap phases), `crm_deals` (value representing total engagement value), and `milestones` (which often correspond to billing triggers). The wizard Step 3 investment tier seeds the initial project budget.

**The build.** A financial dashboard with four layers: (1) a metrics row showing MRR, revenue this period, outstanding balance, and overdue amount; (2) an invoice management table with full lifecycle tracking (draft -> sent -> paid -> overdue); (3) a payment timeline showing collection history; (4) analytics charts showing revenue by client, revenue by service, and project profitability. Quick-create invoice from milestone completion streamlines billing.

**Example.** The agency owner opens the Financial dashboard on Monday morning. The metrics row shows: $47,500 MRR, $62,000 collected this month, $18,500 outstanding, $4,200 overdue. They click the overdue amount and see two invoices: Acme Retail Phase 2 ($2,700, 5 days overdue) and BrightPath Setup ($1,500, 3 days overdue). They send payment reminders with one click each. Then they check the profitability chart and see that e-commerce projects have a 42% margin while healthcare projects are at 28%, prompting a pricing review.

## Core Features

1. **Revenue metrics row** — Four cards at the top: MRR, revenue this month (or selected period), outstanding balance, and overdue amount. Each card shows the current value, a trend arrow (up/down vs prior period), and the percentage change. Overdue card turns red background when amount > 0.
2. **Invoice management table** — Full-lifecycle invoice tracking with columns: invoice number, client, project, amount, status badge, issue date, due date, payment date. Sortable on any column. Row actions: edit, send, record payment, send reminder, delete. Bulk actions for sending multiple invoices.
3. **Payment tracking** — Per-invoice payment recording with amount, date, method, and notes. Partial payments supported (invoice shows remaining balance). Payment timeline visualization showing collection history over time.
4. **Revenue analytics charts** — Revenue by client (horizontal bar chart, top 10), revenue by service/system (donut chart), and monthly revenue trend (line chart with 12-month history). All charts built with Recharts, all filterable by date range.
5. **Project profitability** — Table showing each project's budget (from roadmap), total invoiced, total paid, and margin percentage. Color-coded: green for margin > 30%, amber for 15-30%, red for < 15%.
6. **Overdue management** — Alert banner when overdue invoices exist. One-click "Send Reminder" that logs an activity in the `activities` table and triggers a notification. Escalation indicator for invoices overdue by 7+, 14+, 30+ days.
7. **Quick-create invoice** — When a milestone is marked complete on the project delivery dashboard, a toast suggests creating an invoice. Clicking it opens the create modal pre-filled with the project, client, milestone name as description, and estimated_cost from the roadmap phase.
8. **Revenue forecasting** — AI-powered forecast line extending 3 months beyond historical data, based on pipeline deal values, stage conversion probabilities, and historical payment timing.

## Interaction Patterns

- **Date range change**: Select period from picker -> all metrics, charts, and tables re-filter to the selected range with smooth data transition
- **Filter invoices**: Click status filter button (All/Draft/Sent/Paid/Overdue) -> table filters instantly, count badges update
- **Create invoice**: Click "+ Create Invoice" -> modal opens -> select client and project -> optionally link to milestone (auto-populates amount) -> add line items -> set due date -> save as draft or send immediately
- **Record payment**: Click "Record Payment" on a sent invoice -> modal opens -> enter amount, date, method -> save -> invoice status updates to "paid" (if full) or shows remaining balance (if partial)
- **Send reminder**: Click "Send Reminder" on overdue invoice -> confirmation dialog -> reminder sent -> activity logged -> last reminder date updated on invoice row
- **Chart drill-down**: Click a bar in the revenue by client chart -> invoice table filters to that client's invoices
- **Profitability review**: Click a row in the profitability table -> expands to show per-phase breakdown (roadmap phase estimated_cost vs actual invoiced)

## Example User Workflows

**Workflow 1: Monday morning financial review**
1. Agency owner opens Financial dashboard
2. Date range is set to "This Month" by default
3. Sees metrics: $47,500 MRR (+8%), $62,000 revenue (+12%), $18,500 outstanding, $4,200 overdue
4. Clicks overdue amount -> invoice table filters to 2 overdue invoices
5. Sends reminders for both with one click each
6. Switches to "This Quarter" -> revenue trend chart shows steady growth
7. Checks profitability table -> notices healthcare projects have low margin -> notes to review pricing

**Workflow 2: Invoice creation from milestone**
1. Consultant marks "Phase 1 Complete" milestone on the project delivery dashboard
2. Toast notification appears: "Phase 1 complete. Create invoice for $8,500?"
3. Consultant clicks -> Create Invoice modal opens pre-filled: client "Acme Retail", project "AI Transformation", amount $8,500 (from roadmap_phases.estimated_cost), description "Phase 1: Support Engine Implementation"
4. Consultant adjusts due date to net-30, adds a line item note
5. Clicks "Save & Send" -> invoice sent to client, logged in activities

**Workflow 3: Payment collection**
1. Finance team member opens Financial dashboard, filters to "Sent" invoices
2. Cross-references with bank statement: Acme Retail paid $8,500 yesterday
3. Clicks "Record Payment" on the Acme invoice -> enters amount $8,500, date, method "Bank Transfer"
4. Invoice status changes to "Paid" (green), metrics row updates in real time
5. Revenue by client chart updates to reflect the new payment

---

## AI Features

1. **Revenue forecasting** — Analyzes historical payment data, current pipeline deal values, and stage conversion rates to project revenue 3 months forward. Forecast appears as a dashed line extension on the revenue trend chart with a confidence band.
2. **Auto-generate invoices at milestones** — When a milestone is completed, AI suggests creating an invoice with pre-populated data. If the workflow automation dashboard (031) is configured, this can be fully automatic.
3. **Payment reminder scheduling** — AI determines optimal reminder timing based on client payment history. Clients who typically pay within 3 days get reminders at day 2 after due date. Clients who are habitually late get reminders at day 1.
4. **Profitability insights** — AI analyzes profitability across service types and client segments, surfacing insights like "E-commerce projects average 42% margin while healthcare averages 28%. Consider adjusting healthcare pricing."
5. **Cash flow prediction** — Based on invoice due dates and client payment patterns, AI predicts weekly cash inflows for the next 4 weeks.

## Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary focus**: Revenue metrics row at top — four numbers that answer "how is the business doing financially right now"
2. **Secondary focus**: Invoice table (left) — the operational workhorse where invoices are managed daily
3. **Tertiary focus**: Revenue charts (right) — analytical context showing where money comes from and trends over time
4. **Supporting elements**: Profitability table at bottom — strategic view for pricing and margin decisions
5. **Alert layer**: Overdue banner (red-tinted, above metrics row) — demands attention when money is past due
6. **Typography**: Playfair Display for "Financials" page heading, metric card labels, and chart titles. Lora for all table content, form labels, and body text.
7. **Color coding**: #84CC16 for paid status and positive trends. Red (#DC2626) for overdue status, negative trends, and low margins. Blue (#3B82F6) for sent/pending. Gray (#9CA3AF) for draft. #0A211F for primary text. #D4CFC8 for table borders and dividers.
8. **Number formatting**: All currency values formatted with $ prefix, comma separators, and 2 decimal places. Percentages show 1 decimal place. Trend arrows use green (up/positive) and red (down/negative).

### TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
interface Invoice {
  id: string;
  invoice_number: string;
  client_id: string;
  project_id: string;
  amount: number;
  status: 'draft' | 'sent' | 'paid' | 'overdue';
  issue_date: string;       // ISO date
  due_date: string;         // ISO date
  payment_date: string | null;
  line_items: LineItem[];
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  // joined fields
  client_name?: string;
  project_name?: string;
}

interface LineItem {
  description: string;
  amount: number;
  quantity: number;
}

interface Payment {
  id: string;
  invoice_id: string;
  amount: number;
  payment_date: string;
  method: 'bank_transfer' | 'credit_card' | 'check' | 'other';
  notes: string | null;

  created_at: string;
  // joined
  invoice_number?: string;
}

interface RevenueMetrics {

  preset: 'this_month' | 'this_quarter' | 'this_year' | 'custom';
}

type InvoiceStatusFilter = 'all' | 'draft' | 'sent' | 'paid' | 'overdue';
```

### Custom Hooks

```typescript
// Fetches revenue metrics for the selected date range
function useRevenueMetrics(dateRange: DateRange): {
  metrics: RevenueMetrics | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  refetch: () => void;
};

// Fetches and manages the invoice list with filtering/sorting
function useInvoices(filters: {
  status: InvoiceStatusFilter;
  dateRange: DateRange;
  page: number;
  sortBy: string;
  sortDir: 'asc' | 'desc';
}): {
  invoices: Invoice[];
  total: number;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  createInvoice: (data: Partial<Invoice>) => Promise<Invoice>;
  updateInvoice: (id: string, data: Partial<Invoice>) => Promise<void>;
  deleteInvoice: (id: string) => Promise<void>;
  sendReminder: (id: string) => Promise<void>;
};

// Fetches payment history and records new payments
function usePayments(invoiceId?: string): {
  payments: Payment[];
  loading: boolean;
  recordPayment: (data: Omit<Payment, 'id' | 'created_at'>) => Promise<void>;
};

// Fetches chart data for revenue analytics
function useRevenueCharts(dateRange: DateRange): {
  byClient: RevenueByClient[];
  byService: RevenueByService[];
  trend: RevenueTrendPoint[];
  loading: boolean;
};

// Fetches project profitability data
function useProfitability(dateRange: DateRange): {
  projects: ProjectProfitability[];
  loading: boolean;
};
```

### State Management

| State                   | Location          | Notes                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dateRange`             | URL search params | `?start=2026-01-01&end=2026-01-31&preset=this_month` — shared across all sections |
| `statusFilter`          | `useState`        | Local to `InvoiceFilterBar` + `InvoiceTable`                 |
| `selectedInvoiceId`     | `useState`        | Controls which invoice row is expanded or has modal open      |
| `createModalOpen`       | `useState`        | Controls `CreateInvoiceModal` visibility                      |
| `paymentModalOpen`      | `useState`        | Controls `RecordPaymentModal` visibility                      |
| `sortColumn` / `sortDir`| `useState`        | Local to `InvoiceTable` header click sorting                  |
| `page`                  | `useState`        | Pagination cursor for invoice table                           |
| `chartClientFilter`     | `useState`        | Set when a bar in `RevenueByClientChart` is clicked — filters invoice table |

### Data Fetching Pattern

All hooks call the `api<T>()` helper from `src/lib/supabase.ts`:

```typescript
// useRevenueMetrics
api<RevenueMetrics>('/dashboard/financial/metrics', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: { start: dateRange.start, end: dateRange.end },
});

// useInvoices
api<{ invoices: Invoice[]; total: number }>('/dashboard/financial/invoices', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: { status, dateRange, page, sortBy, sortDir },
});

// usePayments
api<Payment[]>('/dashboard/financial/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: { invoiceId },
});

// useRevenueCharts
api<{ byClient: RevenueByClient[]; byService: RevenueByService[]; trend: RevenueTrendPoint[] }>(
  '/dashboard/financial/charts',
  { method: 'POST', body: { start: dateRange.start, end: dateRange.end } }
);

// useProfitability
api<ProjectProfitability[]>('/dashboard/financial/profitability', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: { start: dateRange.start, end: dateRange.end },
});
```

No global cache library — each hook fetches on mount and when dependencies change. Mutations (create invoice, record payment) call the relevant API, then trigger `refetch()` on the parent data hooks via a shared `refreshKey` counter passed through props.

### Component Communication

- `DateRangePicker` writes to URL search params; all hooks read from the same parsed params via a shared `useDateRange()` hook.
- `InvoiceFilterBar` passes `statusFilter` down to `InvoiceTable` via props.
- `RevenueByClientChart` fires an `onBarClick(clientId)` callback that sets `chartClientFilter` in the page component, which is passed as a prop to `InvoiceTable` to add an additional client filter.
- `CreateInvoiceModal` receives an `onSuccess` callback that bumps a `refreshKey` state, causing `useInvoices` and `useRevenueMetrics` to refetch.
- `QuickInvoiceToast` listens for a custom event (`milestone-completed`) dispatched from the project delivery dashboard and renders a toast with a "Create Invoice" action.

### Supabase Client Queries

```typescript
// ── Revenue metrics ──
// MRR — sum of paid invoices in current month
const { data: mrrData } = await adminClient()
  .from('payments')
  .select('amount')
  .gte('payment_date', startOfMonth)
  .lte('payment_date', endOfMonth);

// Outstanding — unpaid invoices not yet overdue
const { data: outstanding } = await adminClient()
  .from('invoices')
  .select('amount')
  .eq('status', 'sent')
  .gte('due_date', new Date().toISOString());

// Overdue — unpaid invoices past due
const { data: overdue } = await adminClient()
  .from('invoices')
  .select('amount')
  .eq('status', 'sent')
  .lt('due_date', new Date().toISOString());

// ── Invoice list ──
const query = adminClient()
  .from('invoices')
  .select('*, clients(name), projects(name)', { count: 'exact' })
  .order(sortBy, { ascending: sortDir === 'asc' })
  .range(page * PAGE_SIZE, (page + 1) * PAGE_SIZE - 1);

if (status !== 'all') query.eq('status', status);
if (clientId) query.eq('client_id', clientId);

// ── Revenue by client ──
const { data } = await adminClient()
  .from('payments')
  .select('amount, invoices(client_id, clients(name))')
  .gte('payment_date', start)
  .lte('payment_date', end);
// Aggregate in JS: group by client_id, sum amounts, sort desc, take top 10

// ── Revenue by service ──
const { data } = await adminClient()
  .from('payments')
  .select('amount, invoices(project_id, projects(project_services(services(name))))')
  .gte('payment_date', start)
  .lte('payment_date', end);
// Aggregate in JS: group by service name, sum amounts

// ── Revenue trend (monthly) ──
// Use Supabase RPC or raw SQL via adminClient().rpc('revenue_trend', { start, end })
// Fallback: fetch all payments in range, bucket by month in JS

// ── Project profitability ──
const { data: projects } = await adminClient()
  .from('projects')
  .select('id, name, clients(name), roadmaps(total_investment)')
  .eq('status', 'active');

// For each project, sum invoices and payments
const { data: invoiceTotals } = await adminClient()
  .from('invoices')
  .select('project_id, amount')
  .in('project_id', projectIds);

const { data: paymentTotals } = await adminClient()
  .from('payments')
  .select('amount, invoices!inner(project_id)')
  .in('invoices.project_id', projectIds);

// ── Pipeline forecast ──
const { data: deals } = await adminClient()
  .from('crm_deals')
  .select('value, expected_close_date, stage_id')
  .in('stage_id', activeStageIds);
```

### RLS Policies Needed

| Table       | Policy Name                    | Rule                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoices`  | `agency_full_access`           | Allow all operations where `auth.jwt()->>'role' IN ('owner', 'admin', 'consultant')` |
| `invoices`  | `client_read_own`              | Allow SELECT where `client_id = (SELECT client_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())` |
| `payments`  | `agency_full_access`           | Allow all operations where `auth.jwt()->>'role' IN ('owner', 'admin', 'consultant')` |
| `payments`  | `client_read_own`              | Allow SELECT where `invoice_id IN (SELECT id FROM invoices WHERE client_id = ...)` |
| `projects`  | (existing policies apply)      | —                                                                                 |
| `clients`   | (existing policies apply)      | —                                                                                 |

Note: Edge function routes use `adminClient()` (service role key, bypasses RLS) after verifying the JWT role in middleware. RLS policies are the safety net for direct Supabase client access on the frontend.

### API Response TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
interface MetricsResponse {
  mrr: number;
  mrr_trend: number;
  revenue_this_period: number;
  revenue_trend: number;
  outstanding: number;
  overdue: number;
  overdue_count: number;
}

interface InvoiceListResponse {
  invoices: Invoice[];
  total: number;
}

interface CreateInvoiceResponse {
  invoice: Invoice;
}

interface RecordPaymentResponse {
  payment: Payment;
  invoice: Invoice;  // updated invoice with new status/remaining balance
}

interface ChartsResponse {
  byClient: RevenueByClient[];
  byService: RevenueByService[];
  trend: RevenueTrendPoint[];
}

interface ForecastResponse {
  forecast: RevenueTrendPoint[];  // is_forecast = true for all points
  confidence_band: { month: string; low: number; high: number }[];
}
```

### Edge Cases

| Scenario                        | Handling                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No invoices exist               | Metrics return all zeros with `0%` trends; invoice table shows empty state with "Create your first invoice" CTA |
| Partial payment                 | Payment amount < invoice amount: invoice stays `sent`, remaining balance shown on invoice row    |
| Overpayment                     | Reject at API level — payment amount cannot exceed invoice remaining balance                     |
| Unauthorized user               | Edge function verifies JWT; returns `401` with `{ error: "Unauthorized" }`                      |
| Client viewing another client's data | RLS blocks the query; API returns empty result set                                          |
| Deleted project on invoice      | Invoice retains `project_id` but displays "Deleted Project" if join returns null                 |
| Date range returns no data      | Charts render with empty axes and a "No data for this period" overlay                           |
| Invoice status transitions      | Server enforces valid transitions: draft->sent, sent->paid, sent->overdue (auto via cron)       |
