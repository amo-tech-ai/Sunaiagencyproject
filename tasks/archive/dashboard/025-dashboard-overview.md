## Description

**The situation:** After a client completes the 5-step wizard, there is no post-wizard experience. The wizard generates rich AI analysis (business profile, diagnostics, system recommendations, readiness score, roadmap) but all of that data sits in `wizard_answers.ai_results` with no way to view, track, or act on it. Users complete the wizard and hit a dead end.

**Why it matters:** The wizard is the entry point, but the dashboard is the retention surface. Without a command center, clients have no reason to return after the initial analysis. Agency consultants have no single view to monitor project progress across clients. The AI-generated roadmap from Step 5 becomes shelfware instead of an actionable project plan.

**What already exists:** The `wizard_answers` table stores AI results for all 5 steps (ai_results jsonb). The `projects`, `roadmaps`, `roadmap_phases`, `tasks`, and `milestones` tables exist in the schema. The `activities` table is ready for event logging. The marketing site has a sidebar layout pattern in the existing navigation. shadcn/ui provides Card, Progress, Badge, Avatar, and ScrollArea components. The `cn()` utility and design system tokens (colors, fonts) are established.

**The build:** Create a `DashboardOverview` page component at `/app/dashboard` with a sidebar + main content layout. The main area contains: (1) a welcome banner with org name and readiness score from wizard Step 4 ai_results, (2) a metrics row with 4 stat cards, (3) a two-column grid with project summary cards and AI insights panel on top, roadmap timeline and activity feed on the bottom. Data is fetched via custom hooks (`useDashboardData`, `useActivities`) that query Supabase tables with RLS. The sidebar provides navigation to all dashboard sections (Projects, CRM, AI Insights, Documents, Financial, Settings).

**Example:** Acme Retail Group (e-commerce, 50 employees) completed the wizard yesterday. They log in and see: Welcome banner "Acme Retail Group" with AI Readiness Score 72/100 displayed as a circular progress ring. Below, four metric cards show: "72 Readiness Score", "3 AI Systems Selected", "Phase 1 of 3 Active", "$48K Est. Annual ROI". The project summary card shows "AI Transformation — Phase 1: Customer Support Engine" at 15% progress. The activity feed shows "Wizard completed", "Project created", "Roadmap generated". An AI insight card reads: "Your cart abandonment rate (68%) is above industry average. The Cart Recovery Engine in Phase 2 is projected to recover $12K/month."

---

## Rationale

**Problem:** Wizard outputs (readiness score, system recommendations, roadmap) are locked in jsonb with no user-facing view. Clients and consultants cannot track progress or act on AI insights.

**Solution:** A unified dashboard that reads wizard_answers ai_results and project/roadmap tables to present an actionable command center. Standard sidebar + main content layout (not three-panel wizard layout).

**Impact:** Clients return to track progress. Consultants manage engagements from one screen. AI insights drive upsells and re-engagement.

---

## Screen Purpose

The main dashboard is the first screen users see after completing the wizard or logging in. It surfaces a high-level snapshot of their AI transformation journey: active projects, readiness score from wizard Step 4, recommended next actions, recent activity, and key metrics. This is the "command center" that connects wizard outputs to ongoing project delivery.

---

## Target User

- Business owners who completed the wizard and now have an active project
- Agency consultants managing multiple client engagements

## Layout Structure

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Sidebar (240px)  |  Main Content (flex-1)            |
|                  |                                    |
| * Dashboard  <-- |  Welcome Banner + Readiness Score  |
| * Projects       |  +------+------+------+------+    |
| * CRM            |  |Metric|Metric|Metric|Metric|    |
| * AI Insights    |  +------+------+------+------+    |
| * Documents      |                                    |
| * Financial      |  +-------------+-------------+    |
| * Settings       |  | Projects    | AI Insights  |    |
|                  |  | Summary     | Panel        |    |
|                  |  +-------------+-------------+    |
|                  |  | Roadmap     | Activity     |    |
|                  |  | Timeline    | Feed         |    |
|                  |  +-------------+-------------+    |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

- Sidebar: 240px fixed, `#0A211F` background, `#F1EEEA` text, `#84CC16` active indicator
- Main content: `#F1EEEA` background, `max-w-[1200px] mx-auto`, 24px padding
- Cards: `#FFFFFF` background, `#D4CFC8` border, 8px radius
- Responsive: sidebar collapses to hamburger on mobile (<768px)

---

## Interaction Patterns

- Click project card -> navigate to project detail (`/app/projects/:id`)
- Click roadmap phase -> expand phase details inline with task list
- Click quick action -> navigate to respective screen
- Activity feed auto-refreshes every 60 seconds (or Supabase Realtime subscription)
- Score card click -> expand to full readiness breakdown with radar chart
- AI insight dismiss/snooze -> mark as read in activities table
- Sidebar nav items highlight active route

---

## Example User Workflows

**Workflow 1 — First login after wizard:** Acme Retail (e-commerce, 50 employees) completed the wizard yesterday. They log in and see: Readiness Score 72 displayed prominently with a circular progress ring. Below, 3 selected systems (Support Engine, Cart Recovery, Recommendation Engine) are listed. The roadmap shows Phase 1 of 3 starting next week. Four AI-generated quick wins from their Step 2 diagnostics appear in the insights panel: "Automate ticket routing to reduce 40-hour/week manual triage."

**Workflow 2 — Weekly check-in:** Agency consultant Maria opens the dashboard for client GreenLeaf Healthcare. She sees 2 of 5 milestones completed for Phase 1. The readiness score improved from 65 to 78 after Phase 1 delivery. An AI insight suggests adding a patient scheduling system based on the original Step 2 diagnostic finding that "appointment no-shows cost $8K/month." Maria clicks "Schedule Call" to discuss the upsell.

**Workflow 3 — Returning after inactivity:** Client TechNova Solutions hasn't logged in for 3 weeks. The dashboard shows a notification badge on the activity feed: "3 milestones overdue." The AI insights panel prominently displays: "Your project timeline is at risk — 2 tasks in Phase 2 are blocked. Consider scheduling a review call." The quick action "Schedule Call" is highlighted with a `#84CC16` border.

---

## AI Features

- AI-generated "next best action" recommendations based on project state + readiness gaps
- Proactive insights: "Your cart abandonment rate suggests upgrading to the premium recommendation engine"
- Readiness score auto-recalculation when new project data arrives (via assistant agent)
- Activity summarization: "This week: 3 milestones completed, 2 new tasks created"
- Dashboard greeting personalized with business context from Step 1 analysis

---

## Data Sources (tables)

| Data | Table | Column/Query |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Org name | organizations | name |
| Readiness score | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 4 |
| Score dimensions | wizard_answers | ai_results -> dimensions where step_number = 4 |
| Selected systems | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 3 |
| Business profile | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 1 |
| Diagnostics | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 2 |
| Projects | projects | where org_id = current org |
| Roadmap phases | roadmap_phases | via roadmaps.project_id |
| Tasks | tasks | where project_id, grouped by status |
| Activities | activities | where org_id, order by created_at desc limit 10 |
| Milestones | milestones | where project_id, status != 'completed', order by due_date |
| AI run history | ai_run_logs | count, last run timestamp per org_id |

---

## Automation Opportunities

- Auto-create project from wizard completion (wizard Step 5 -> projects insert + roadmap_phases insert)
- Auto-populate roadmap phases from AI-generated roadmap (Step 5 ai_results -> roadmap_phases rows)
- Trigger re-analysis when project enters new phase (update readiness score)
- Weekly summary email generated from dashboard data (activities + milestones)
- Slack/email notification when milestone due date is approaching (< 3 days)
- Auto-log activity when wizard completes, project status changes, or milestone completes

---

## Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary focus**: Readiness score + welcome banner (top, largest, full width)
2. **Secondary**: Metrics row + project summary cards (data-dense, medium prominence)
3. **Tertiary**: Roadmap timeline (horizontal, scannable, color-coded phases)
4. **Supporting**: Activity feed + AI insights (right column, scrollable, lower contrast)

---

## User Stories

| As a... | I want to... | So that... |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Client | see my readiness score and project status on one screen | I understand where my AI transformation stands |
| Client | see AI-generated next actions | I know what to focus on without reading the full analysis |
| Agency consultant | view a client's dashboard | I can prepare for status calls with current data |
| Agency owner | see project phase progress across clients | I can identify at-risk engagements early |
| Returning user | see recent activity and changes | I can catch up quickly after being away |

  description: string;

}
```

### Custom Hooks

```typescript
// src/lib/hooks/useDashboardData.ts
function useDashboardData(orgId: string): {
  data: DashboardData | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  refresh: () => void;
}

// src/lib/hooks/useActivities.ts
function useActivities(orgId: string, limit?: number): {
  activities: ActivityItem[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  hasMore: boolean;
  loadMore: () => void;
}

// src/lib/hooks/useReadinessScore.ts
function useReadinessScore(orgId: string): {
  score: ReadinessData | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

### State Management

| State | Location | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `orgId` | AuthContext (React Context) | Set at login, available app-wide |
| `dashboardData` | `useDashboardData` hook (useState) | Fetched once on mount, refreshable |
| `activities` | `useActivities` hook (useState) | Paginated, append-only on loadMore |
| `expandedInsight` | DashboardOverview local useState | Only this page needs it |
| `sidebarCollapsed` | DashboardLayout local useState + localStorage | Persisted across sessions |
| `activePhaseId` | RoadmapTimeline local useState | Highlight/scroll state |

### Data Fetching Pattern

```
useDashboardData(orgId)
  └── api<DashboardData>('/dashboard/overview', { method: 'POST', body: { orgId } })
        ↳ single edge function aggregates: organizations, wizard_answers, projects,
          roadmaps, roadmap_phases, milestones

useActivities(orgId)
  └── api<{ activities: ActivityItem[] }>('/dashboard/activities', {
        method: 'POST', body: { orgId, limit: 10, offset }
      })

useReadinessScore(orgId)  — used standalone if score card is rendered elsewhere
  └── api<ReadinessData>('/dashboard/readiness', { method: 'POST', body: { orgId } })
```

- Caching: No external cache library. `useDashboardData` stores result in useState; `refresh()` re-fetches. Consider `stale-while-revalidate` pattern — show cached data immediately, fetch in background.
- Token: All hooks call `authApi.getSession()` first to obtain `access_token`, pass as `token` in `api()`.

### Component Communication

- **Props down**: `DashboardOverview` passes `dashboardData.projects` to `ProjectSummaryCard`, `dashboardData.roadmap.phases` to `RoadmapTimeline`, etc.
- **Callbacks up**: `QuickActionsGrid` receives `onAction: (action: string) => void` — parent uses `useNavigate()` to route.
- **Shared context**: `AuthContext` provides `orgId`, `user`, `accessToken`. No dashboard-specific context needed — single page, single fetch.
- **Sidebar-to-page**: `DashboardLayout` renders `<Outlet />` from React Router; sidebar nav uses `<NavLink>` with `isActive` for highlighting.

## Backend Wiring

### New Edge Function Routes

| Method | Route | Handler | Request Body | Response Shape |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| POST | `/dashboard/overview` | Aggregates org, wizard, projects, roadmap data | `{ orgId: string }` | `DashboardData` |
| POST | `/dashboard/activities` | Paginated activity feed | `{ orgId: string, limit: number, offset: number }` | `{ activities: ActivityItem[], total: number }` |
| POST | `/dashboard/readiness` | Readiness score from wizard step 4 | `{ orgId: string }` | `ReadinessData` |
| POST | `/dashboard/insights` | AI-generated insights from wizard data | `{ orgId: string }` | `{ insights: AIInsight[] }` |
| POST | `/dashboard/metrics` | Computed metric cards | `{ orgId: string }` | `DashboardMetrics` |

### Supabase Client Queries

```typescript
// /dashboard/overview handler — inside edge function

// 1. Organization
const { data: org } = await adminClient()
  .from('organizations')
  .select('id, name, industry, logo_url')
  .eq('id', orgId)
  .single();

// 2. Readiness score from wizard step 4
const { data: readinessAnswer } = await adminClient()
  .from('wizard_answers')
  .select('ai_results')
  .eq('session_id', sessionId)      // resolved via wizard_sessions.org_id
  .eq('step_number', 4)
  .single();
// readinessAnswer.ai_results -> { overallScore, dimensions[] }

// 3. Selected systems from wizard step 3
const { data: systemsAnswer } = await adminClient()
  .from('wizard_answers')
  .select('ai_results')
  .eq('session_id', sessionId)
  .eq('step_number', 3)
  .single();

// 4. Active projects
const { data: projects } = await adminClient()
  .from('projects')
  .select('id, name, status, created_at')
  .eq('org_id', orgId)
  .in('status', ['active', 'draft']);

// 5. Roadmap phases
const { data: phases } = await adminClient()
  .from('roadmap_phases')
  .select('id, name, status, progress_percent, week_range, position')
  .eq('roadmap_id', roadmapId)
  .order('position', { ascending: true });

// 6. Recent activities
const { data: activities } = await adminClient()
  .from('activities')
  .select('id, type, description, created_at, actor_name, actor_avatar_url')
  .eq('org_id', orgId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(10);

// 7. Next milestone
const { data: milestone } = await adminClient()
  .from('milestones')
  .select('id, name, due_date, status')
  .eq('project_id', projectId)
  .neq('status', 'completed')
  .order('due_date', { ascending: true })
  .limit(1)
  .single();

// 8. Wizard session lookup
const { data: session } = await adminClient()
  .from('wizard_sessions')
  .select('id, status, current_step')
  .eq('org_id', orgId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(1)
  .single();
```

### RLS Policies Needed

| Table | Policy | Rule |
|-------|--------|------|
| organizations | SELECT own org | `auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM org_members WHERE org_id = organizations.id)` |
| wizard_sessions | SELECT own org sessions | `org_id IN (SELECT org_id FROM org_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())` |
| wizard_answers | SELECT via session | `session_id IN (SELECT id FROM wizard_sessions WHERE org_id IN (...))` |
| projects | SELECT own org projects | `org_id IN (SELECT org_id FROM org_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())` |
| roadmaps | SELECT via project | `project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE org_id IN (...))` |
| roadmap_phases | SELECT via roadmap | `roadmap_id IN (SELECT id FROM roadmaps WHERE project_id IN (...))` |
| activities | SELECT own org activities | `org_id IN (SELECT org_id FROM org_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())` |
| milestones | SELECT via project | `project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE org_id IN (...))` |
| ai_run_logs | SELECT own org | `org_id IN (SELECT org_id FROM org_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())` |

Note: Edge functions use `adminClient()` (service role key) which bypasses RLS. These policies are for direct frontend Supabase client queries and as a defense-in-depth layer.

### API Response TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
// Edge function response shapes (mirrored in frontend types)

interface DashboardOverviewResponse {
  organization: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    industry: string;
    logo_url: string | null;
  };
  readiness: {
    overallScore: number;
    dimensions: { name: string; score: number; label: string }[];
    assessedAt: string;
  };
  metrics: {
    readinessScore: number;
    systemsSelected: number;
    activePhase: { number: number; total: number; name: string };
    estimatedROI: number;
  };
  projects: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    status: string;
    currentPhase: string;
    progressPercent: number;

    }[];
  };
  insights: {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    body: string;
    category: string;
    priority: string;
    dismissed: boolean;
    sourceStep: number;
  }[];
}

interface ActivitiesResponse {
  activities: {
    id: string;
    type: string;
    description: string;
    createdAt: string;
    actorName: string;
    actorAvatarUrl: string | null;
  }[];
  total: number;
}
```

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| No wizard data (user created org but never started wizard) | Return `readiness: null`, `insights: []`. Frontend shows "Complete the wizard to get started" CTA with link to `/wizard` |
| Wizard partially completed (e.g. only Step 1-2) | Return available data. Readiness score is null if Step 4 not done. Systems count is 0 if Step 3 not done. Show "Continue your assessment" CTA |
| No projects yet (wizard done but project not auto-created) | `projects: []`. Show empty state card: "Your roadmap is ready — generate your project plan" |
| Unauthorized (no valid JWT or user not in org) | Edge function returns `{ error: "Unauthorized" }` with 401. Frontend redirects to `/login` |
| Organization deleted or missing | 404 response. Frontend shows "Organization not found" error state |
| Activity feed empty | Return `activities: [], total: 0`. Frontend shows "No activity yet" placeholder |
| Multiple wizard sessions (user re-ran wizard) | Use most recent completed session (`ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1 WHERE status = 'completed'`) |
| Roadmap phases have no tasks yet | `progressPercent: 0` for all phases. Timeline renders with 0% bars |

## Outcomes

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Wizard completes and user sees nothing — dead end | User lands on a command center with score, projects, roadmap, and next actions |
| Readiness score locked in wizard_answers jsonb | Score displayed as circular progress ring with 5-dimension breakdown |
| AI roadmap exists only as Step 5 output | Roadmap rendered as interactive timeline with phase progress |
| No activity history visible | Chronological feed shows wizard completion, project creation, milestone events |
| No post-wizard engagement surface | AI insights panel drives return visits with proactive recommendations |
