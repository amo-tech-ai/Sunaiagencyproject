>     - 2-3 bullet points tied to user's specific answers, each with a small arrow icon:
>       - "Your support is currently manual — this automates 60-80% of inquiries"
>       - "Customers primarily find you via Google — chatbot improves on-site conversion"
>   - **Impact row** (horizontal, 3 metrics in small cards):
>     - "Expected Impact: High" — green badge
>     - "Effort: Medium" — amber badge

>
>   **Show 4-6 recommendation cards total.** Example systems for E-commerce:
>   1. "AI Customer Support Engine" — #1 priority
>   2. "Cart Recovery & Follow-Up System" — #2
>   3. "Personalized Recommendation Engine" — #3
>   4. "Sales & Marketing Automation Suite" — #4
>   5. "Customer Loyalty & Retention System" — #5
>
>   **Non-recommended section** (below recommendations):
>   - Subtle divider with text: "Other available systems"
>   - Collapsed by default — "Show 3 more systems >"
>   - These are systems not recommended but available to select
>   - Cards have muted styling: no priority badge, lighter border
>
> **Right Panel (320px, white):**
> - Sticky header: "Your Selection Summary" — Playfair Display, dark teal
> - Dynamic content updates as user selects/deselects:
>

>   - Shown as a horizontal bar with tiers, current tier highlighted
>   - Divider
>   - "Recommendation" note:
>     - "We recommend starting with your top 2-3 priorities and expanding after initial results."
>     - Subtle, advisory tone — not pushy
>
> **Footer Bar:**
> - Left: "Back" text button
> - Center: "All changes saved" with green dot
> - Right: "Continue" button — active only when at least 1 system is selected
> - Micro-text above Continue: "You can change selections later"
>
> **Design Direction:**
> - This is the most visually rich screen — but still calm and structured
> - Cards should feel substantial but not heavy — white with good spacing
> - The priority badges create a natural reading order
> - Selected cards should feel "activated" — lime green border, slightly elevated feel
> - The right panel summary should feel like a live receipt updating in real-time
> - Transitions: when selecting a card, smooth border color change (200ms). When a system appears in the right panel, slide-in animation
> - No overwhelming animations — everything is subtle and professional
> - The "Why this fits" section is the most important — it must feel personalized, not generic
>
> **Responsive:**
> - Mobile: cards stack full width. Right panel becomes a sticky bottom bar showing "X systems selected — View Summary" that opens a bottom sheet
> - Tablet: two columns — cards + right panel as slide-over
> - Desktop: full three-panel layout

## Workflow

1. **User arrives at /app/wizard/step-3**
   - Check ai_cache for pre-computed recommendations (from the Step 2 trigger)
   - If cached: load and display immediately
   - If not cached: run the recommendation Edge Function synchronously (show skeleton loading state)
   - Load the systems catalog from the systems and system_services tables
   - Load any saved step-3 selections from project_systems

2. **Display recommendations**
   - Cards are ranked by AI priority score
   - Each card is populated with personalized "why it fits" content from the AI
   - Non-recommended systems are collapsed below the main recommendations

3. **User selects or deselects systems**
   - Toggle saves to project_systems (is_selected set to true or false)
   - Right panel summary updates immediately
   - Left panel "Your Selections" list updates
   - Changes are debounce-saved to wizard_answers.data

4. **User reorders systems (optional drag-and-drop)**
   - Update the priority order in project_systems or wizard_answers

5. **User clicks "Continue"**
   - Validate that at least 1 system is selected
   - Final save of all selections
   - Update wizard_sessions.current_step to 4
   - Navigate to step-4

## Agent Behavior
- **AI is visible on this screen** — recommendations are AI-generated
- "Why it fits" bullets reference specific user answers from Steps 1-2
- Impact/effort scores come from AI analysis cross-referenced with system metadata
- AI explains but never decides — user must explicitly select
- If user selects 5+ systems, right panel shows advisory note: "Consider starting with 2-3 priorities"
- All AI reasoning stored in `project_systems.recommendation_metadata`
