// S-AGENT-LOADER — Core utility for loading and compiling agent prompts at runtime
// Functions:
//   extractExcerpt(slug, sections?) — get agent profile data for prompt injection
//   selectAgents(route, context)    — choose agents based on goal + industry + size
//   compilePrompt(base, excerpt, instructions, schema?) — assemble 4-layer prompt
//   getAgentMeta(slug)              — return agent metadata (name, division, emoji, etc.)
//
// The agent registry is embedded server-side (no filesystem reads needed).
// Agent .md files are NOT used at runtime — this registry IS the source of truth
// for prompt compilation. The frontend catalog (agentCatalog.ts) is independent.
