## Component Details

### 01 - Hero Section (`MVPv2Hero`)

**Background:** Dark Teal (#0F3D3E) with dot pattern  
**Layout:** Two-column grid (text left, 6-week timeline right)

**Copy:**
- **Eyebrow:** "MVP BUILDER"
- **Headline:** "Your AI Product, *Live* in 6 Weeks"
- **Subhead:** "We turn product ideas into working MVPs—scoped, architected, and shipped for real users. Skip the 6-month cycle. Launch the version that proves demand."
- **Primary CTA:** "Start Your MVP Brief" → `/booking`
- **Secondary CTA:** "View MVPs We've Shipped" → `/projects`
- **Proof Line:** "8 MVPs launched in the last 12 months. 3 went on to raise funding."

**Micro-trust Bullets:**
- Weekly deployments (not "big reveal" demos)
- Production-grade foundations (no rebuild trap)
- Clear scope + fixed timeline

**6-Week Timeline Visual:**
- Week 1: Scope (#84CC16)
- Week 2: Architecture (#9DD679)
- Week 3: Build (#0A9396)
- Week 4: Build (#0A9396)
- Week 5: AI + Polish (#84CC16)
- Week 6: Launch (#1E3D36)

### 02 - Why MVP First (`WhyMVPFirst`)

**Background:** Beige (#F4F3EE)

**Copy:**
- **Eyebrow:** "THE CASE FOR MVP"
- **Headline:** "Build the Proof Before You Build the Company"
- **Body (2 paragraphs):**
  - "Investors don't fund ideas—they fund evidence. Users don't buy roadmaps—they buy products. The fastest path to revenue (and funding) is a working product in real hands generating real usage data."
  - "Traditional builds delay learning until the end. Our approach flips it: ship the core value first, measure what happens, then expand based on proof—not opinions."

**What You Gain (3 Bullets):**
- You learn what users actually do (not what they say)
- You de-risk the build before you scale the team
- You get a credible story: "Here's the product. Here's the data."

**Comparison Table:**
- **Traditional Approach:** Build everything before showing anyone, 6-12 month cycle, high risk
- **Our MVP Approach:** Ship core value in 6 weeks, real users from week 7, low risk

---

### 03 - Deliverables (`MVPv2Deliverables`)

**Background:** White

**Copy:**
- **Eyebrow:** "DELIVERABLES"
- **Headline:** "From Concept to Deployed Product"
- **Body:** "You get a complete MVP engagement: scope, architecture, design, build, AI integration, deployment, and launch support. This is not a clickable prototype. It's a real product you can onboard users into."

**6 Phase Cards:**
1. **Week 1 — Scope Workshop:** Define v1 with ruthless focus. We prioritize features around one measurable hypothesis.
2. **Week 1–2 — Architecture & Data Design:** Database schema, AI capability map, APIs, integrations, deployment plan.
3. **Week 2–4 — Core Build (2 Sprints):** Daily visibility, staging environment, weekly releases, tight feedback loop.
4. **Week 4–5 — AI Integration + Product Polish:** AI features wired in (search, recommendations, automation), UI refinement, performance pass.
5. **Week 5–6 — Launch & Onboarding:** Production deploy, monitoring, analytics, admin training, handoff docs.
6. **Post-Launch — 30 Days Support:** Bug fixes + weekly review of usage data → v2 priorities.

**Real-World MVP Examples:**
- **AI Support Inbox:** Web chat + helpdesk triage + "suggested replies" trained on your docs
- **Internal Ops Copilot:** One dashboard that answers team questions + automates routine workflows
- **Lead-to-Call Funnel:** Landing page + qualification + booking + CRM capture + follow-up automation

---

### 04 - Framework (`MVPv2Framework`)

**Background:** Beige (#F4F3EE)

**Copy:**
- **Eyebrow:** "FRAMEWORK"
- **Headline:** "Scoped for Validation. *Built* for Scale."
- **Body:** "Most MVPs fail because they're built like demos. We build MVPs like foundations: clean architecture, tested flows, and deployment discipline—so if it works, you can scale without rebuilding from scratch."

**2x2 Principles Grid:**
1. **Production-Grade Architecture:** Same engineering standards as full-scale builds. The difference is scope—not quality.
2. **Scoped for Validation:** Every v1 feature proves something: demand, willingness to pay, workflow lift, retention.
3. **AI-Native from Day One:** AI is designed into the system early (not bolted on at the end).
4. **Built for Handoff:** Documentation, CI/CD, clear structure—so your future team can continue immediately.

**Anti-bullshit Line:** "No vague timelines. No 'phase 2 will fix it.' v1 ships with real capabilities."

---

### 05 - Who This Is For (`MVPv2WhoThisIsFor`)

**Background:** Dark Teal (#0F3D3E) with dot pattern

**Copy:**
- **Eyebrow:** "BEST FIT"
- **Headline:** "Founders With Ideas That Need to Ship"
- **Body:** "You've done enough thinking. You need a partner who can translate your concept into a working product—fast, without compromise, and without the overhead of hiring a full team."

**3 Profile Cards:**
1. **Solo Founders & Small Teams:** You have vision + domain expertise. We handle execution so you can focus on users, sales, and feedback.
2. **Funded Startups Launching a New Line:** Your team is busy on the core roadmap. We ship a focused MVP without stealing bandwidth.
3. **Companies Building Internal AI Tools:** Off-the-shelf tools don't fit. We build the internal system that saves hours every week.

**Best For:** Pre-seed → Series A, or SMB teams with a clear workflow problem to automate.

### 06 - CTA Section (`MVPv2CTA`)

**Background:** Dark Teal (#0F3D3E) with dot pattern  
**Animation:** Top divider line scales horizontally

**Copy:**
- **Headline:** "Stop Planning. Start Building."
- **Body:** "Book a 30-minute MVP strategy session. We'll pressure-test the concept, define the v1 scope, estimate timeline + investment, and tell you plainly if we're the right fit. If yes, we can start the scope workshop the same week."
- **CTA Button:** "Start Your MVP Brief" → `/booking`
- **Subtext:** "Free 30-minute session. No obligations. No pitch deck required."
