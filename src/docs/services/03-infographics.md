# Sun AI Agency — AI Infographics & Visual Intelligence Page

**Route:** `/services/infographics`
**Component:** `/components/services/InfographicsPage.tsx`
**Status:** Planning
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview

A premium editorial-style landing page positioning Sun AI as the company that turns complex AI strategy, automation, systems, and results into clear visual content: infographics, animated explainers, process diagrams, AI system maps, dashboard visuals, ROI storyboards, and motion-based business presentations.

**Design Direction:** Luxury editorial + modern SaaS aesthetic — dark/refined, strategic, premium consulting feel, elegant typography (Playfair Display headlines, system sans-serif body), strong whitespace, subtle motion, sharp diagrams, structured grids. NOT playful, cartoonish, or neon sci-fi.

**Color Palette (BCG Style Guide aligned):**
- Deep forest / near-black backgrounds: `#0F1A15`, `#1A3A32`
- Warm cream / parchment sections: `#FAF8F5`, `#F5F0EB`
- Muted gold / sand accents: `#C9A84C`, `#D4B86A`
- Emerald/green CTA highlights: `#2A9D6F`, `#1A3A32`
- Charcoal text on light: `#1b1b1b`
- White text on dark: `#FFFFFF`, `#E8E0D4`

- `lucide-react` for icons
- `react-router` for Link/navigation
- `react-responsive-masonry` for S5 gallery layout
- Unsplash via ImageWithFallback only if needed (prefer CSS/SVG diagrams)

## 5. Route Registration

Add to `/routes.tsx`:
```tsx
import InfographicsPage from './components/services/InfographicsPage';
// ...
{ path: 'services/infographics', Component: InfographicsPage },
```

## 6. Responsive Breakpoints

- Desktop: full editorial layouts, horizontal process, 3-col grids
- Tablet (md): 2-col grids, stacked hero
- Mobile: single column, vertical timeline, stacked cards

## 7. Animation Strategy
