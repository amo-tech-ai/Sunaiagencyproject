## 🎬 Animation System

All sections use scroll-triggered animations:
- **Library:** Motion (motion/react)
- **Hook:** `useInView` with `once: true`
- **Margin:** `-100px` (triggers before viewport)
- **Duration:** 0.6–0.8 seconds
- **Stagger:** 0.1s delay between sequential elements
- **Transitions:** Smooth opacity and Y-position changes

Example:
```typescript
const ref = useRef(null);
const isInView = useInView(ref, { once: true, margin: '-100px' });

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 40 }}
  animate={isInView ? { opacity: 1, y: 0 } : { opacity: 0, y: 40 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
>
```
