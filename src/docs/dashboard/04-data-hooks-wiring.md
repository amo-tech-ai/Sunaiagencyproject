# 04 — DATA HOOKS & BACKEND WIRING
# Frontend Hooks, API Layer, Edge Functions, Data Flow

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Parent Doc:** `00-dashboard-master.md`

---

## PURPOSE

This document specifies every data hook the dashboard needs, every API call those hooks make, every edge function endpoint involved, and the exact data flow from Supabase tables through the edge function through the frontend API layer through the hook into the React component. No ambiguity about where data comes from or how it gets to the screen.

## HOOKS SPECIFICATION

### useDashboardData

Location: /lib/hooks/useDashboardData.ts

Purpose: fetch and assemble all data the dashboard home page needs from a single hook call.

Input: userId (from useAuth), accessToken (from useAuth).

Returns:
- org: { name, industry, size, goal } or null
- readiness: { overallScore, scoreBreakdown, maturityLevel, gaps, strengths, nextSteps } or null
- project: { name, totalWeeks, investment, phases, quickWins, successMetrics, riskFactors } or null
- systems: { selected: string[], count: number }
- activities: { id, action, timestamp, entityType }[]
- metrics: { readinessScore, systemsCount, currentPhase, phaseCount, estimatedROI }
- sessionId: string or null
- sessionStatus: string (in_progress, completed)
- loading: boolean
- error: string or null
- refresh: () => void

Behavior:
1. On mount, if userId is available, call wizardApi.list(userId, accessToken)
2. From the list, find the most recent session (prefer status completed, fallback to in_progress)
3. Call wizardApi.load(sessionId, accessToken) to get full data
4. Parse ai_results from each answer row into typed dashboard state
5. Derive activities from answer updated_at timestamps
6. Derive metrics from parsed data
7. Set loading false
8. Expose a refresh function that re-runs the entire fetch

Caching: store the parsed result in a ref so navigating between dashboard pages does not re-fetch. The refresh function clears the cache and re-fetches. Consider a 60-second auto-refresh interval for the activity feed.

Error handling: if list returns empty, set sessionId null (triggers empty state). If load fails, set error message and expose retry via refresh. If individual ai_results are null for a step, that section shows "Not available" rather than crashing.

### useActivities

Location: /lib/hooks/useActivities.ts

Purpose: fetch activity feed data, initially derived from wizard data, later from activities table.

Input: sessionId, accessToken.

Returns:
- activities: { id, action, entityType, timestamp, metadata }[]
- loading: boolean
- error: string or null

MVP behavior: call wizardApi.load(sessionId) and derive activities from answer rows. Each answer row with ai_results generates an activity like "Business analyzed" with the updated_at timestamp. The session itself generates "Wizard completed" if status is completed.

Future behavior: call GET /activities/list/:sessionId and return proper activity rows.

### useProjectTasks

Location: /lib/hooks/useProjectTasks.ts

Purpose: manage task status for project detail and roadmap pages.

Input: sessionId, phases (from useDashboardData).

Returns:
- tasksByPhase: Record of phaseNumber to array of { index, title, status }
- toggleTask: (phaseNumber, taskIndex) => void
- phaseProgress: (phaseNumber) => { completed, total, percentage }
- loading: boolean

MVP behavior: task statuses stored in localStorage keyed by sessionId. Tasks are derived from the deliverables array in each roadmap phase. toggleTask cycles through not-started → in-progress → completed → not-started. phaseProgress calculates from current statuses.

Future behavior: task statuses stored in the tasks table via PATCH /tasks/:id. Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime subscription on tasks table.

### useDashboardInsights

Location: /lib/hooks/useDashboardInsights.ts

Purpose: fetch AI-generated insights for the insights panel.

Input: sessionId, accessToken.

Returns:
- insights: { id, priority, title, description, actionLabel, actionRoute }[]
- loading: boolean
- error: string or null
- refresh: () => void

MVP behavior (before /dashboard-insights endpoint exists): derive 2-4 insights locally from the readiness gaps and quick wins already in ai_results. Rules:
- If readiness has gaps with priority high, create a "HIGH" insight for the top gap
- If roadmap has quickWins, create a "SUGGESTION" insight for the first quick win
- If diagnostics has painPoints with severity high, create a "MEDIUM" insight
- Always include: "Schedule kickoff call" suggestion

Future behavior: call POST /dashboard-insights with sessionId and project state. Use the AI-generated response instead of derived insights.

---

## API LAYER ADDITIONS

Add to lib/supabase.ts:

### dashboardApi module

- getInsights: calls POST /dashboard-insights with sessionId and optional projectState, returns typed InsightsResponse
- getActivities: calls GET /activities/list/:sessionId, returns typed ActivitiesResponse
- updateTaskStatus: calls PATCH /tasks/:id with new status, returns success boolean (future, not MVP)

### Type additions

DashboardData: the full return type of useDashboardData

InsightsResponse: { insights: DashboardInsight[] }, where DashboardInsight has id, priority, title, description, actionLabel, actionRoute

ActivitiesResponse: { activities: ActivityItem[] }, where ActivityItem has id, action, entityType, entityId, timestamp, metadata

TaskStatusUpdate: { taskId, status, updatedBy }

---

## EDGE FUNCTION ADDITIONS

### POST /dashboard-insights (in ai-routes.tsx)

New route added to the ai Hono router.

Accepts: sessionId in request body. Optionally projectState with currentPhase, completedTasks, overdueMilestones.

Behavior:
1. Load wizard_answers for the session (all 5 steps) using adminClient
2. Extract readiness gaps, diagnostic pain points, system recommendations, roadmap quick wins, and success metrics
3. Assemble a context object summarizing the org's current state
4. Call callGemini with prompt type "dashboard-insights", a system prompt about project management recommendations, and the assembled context as user prompt
5. Parse the structured JSON response (2-4 insights)
6. Cache with 4-hour TTL
7. Return the insights array

System prompt: "You are a senior project advisor at Sun AI Agency. The client has completed a discovery wizard and has an active AI transformation project. Based on their readiness score, diagnostic findings, selected systems, and roadmap progress, recommend 2-4 specific next actions they should take this week. Each recommendation must be actionable, specific (include numbers and data points from their analysis), and prioritized. Return JSON."

Response JSON structure: array of objects each with id (string), priority (high, medium, suggestion), title (string, max 60 chars), description (string, 2-3 sentences with specific data), actionLabel (string, button text), actionRoute (string, relative URL).

### GET /activities/list/:sessionId (in wizard-routes.tsx)

New route added to the wizard Hono router.

Accepts: sessionId as URL param.

Behavior:
1. Load wizard_answers for the session ordered by updated_at desc
2. Load wizard_sessions for the session
3. For each answer row, generate a derived activity based on step_number and whether ai_results exists
4. Add session-level activities (created, completed)
5. Sort all activities by timestamp desc
6. Return the activities array

Activity derivation map:
- Step 1 with ai_results → "Business profile analyzed"
- Step 1 without ai_results → "Business context entered"
- Step 2 with ai_results → "Industry diagnostics completed"
- Step 3 with ai_results → "AI systems recommended"
- Step 3 without ai_results → "Systems selected"
- Step 4 with ai_results → "Readiness scored: [score]/100"
- Step 4 without ai_results → "Executive summary drafted"
- Step 5 with ai_results → "Implementation roadmap generated"
- Session status completed → "Wizard completed"
- Session created → "Discovery session started"

## DATA FRESHNESS STRATEGY

The dashboard should feel current without hammering the API.

| Data | Freshness | Strategy |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Wizard session + answers | Load once per page visit | Cached in hook ref, re-fetched on manual refresh |
| AI insights | Every 4 hours | Gemini cache TTL handles this server-side; frontend re-fetches on each mount |
| Activities | Every 60 seconds | Auto-refresh interval in useActivities, or Supabase Realtime when available |
| Task statuses | Real-time | Stored in localStorage (MVP), or Realtime subscription on tasks table (future) |
| Readiness score | On-demand | Only re-calculated when user clicks "Re-run Analysis" |

---

## ERROR HANDLING MATRIX

| Scenario | Frontend Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| wizardApi.list returns network error | Show full-page error card with retry button |
| wizardApi.list returns empty array | Show EmptyDashboard with wizard CTA |
| wizardApi.load returns 404 | Show "Session not found" with option to start new wizard |
| wizardApi.load returns 500 | Show error card with retry, log to console |
| ai_results null for step 4 | ReadinessScoreCard shows "—" with "Run analysis" link |
| ai_results null for step 5 | RoadmapTimeline shows static fallback phases |
| /dashboard-insights fails | AIInsightsPanel shows derived insights (local fallback) |
| Auth token expired | Supabase client auto-refreshes; if refresh fails, redirect to /login |
| Slow connection (> 3s) | Skeleton screens visible immediately, data fills in progressively |

---

## PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT PATH

### Phase 1 — MVP (zero new tables)
All data from wizard_sessions and wizard_answers via existing endpoints. Tasks in localStorage. Activities derived from timestamps. Insights derived locally.

### Phase 2 — With activities table
Activities read from the activities table. Task changes and milestone completions log activities. Activity feed is live via Realtime subscription.

### Phase 3 — With projects + tasks tables
Projects read from the projects table. Tasks read from the tasks table with proper status persistence. Milestones read from the milestones table. Phase progress calculated from task rows.

### Phase 4 — With AI insights endpoint
POST /dashboard-insights returns Gemini-generated contextual recommendations. Insights are cached server-side with 4-hour TTL.

### Phase 5 — With Realtime
Task status changes broadcast via Realtime. Activity feed updates in real-time. Presence shows connected collaborators.

Each phase is independently deployable. The hooks abstract the data source so components never know whether they are reading from ai_results jsonb or a proper table.

## CLIENT MANAGEMENT HOOKS & WIRING

### useClients

Location: /lib/hooks/useClients.ts

Purpose: fetch paginated, filtered, sorted client list for the CRM table.

Input: filters (search, status, industry, consultantId), sort (column, direction), pagination (page, pageSize), accessToken.

Returns:
- clients: ClientListItem[] (name, industry, status, primary contact, wizard progress, project count, last activity, health score, consultant)
- total: number
- filterOptions: { industries: string[], consultants: { id, name }[] }
- loading: boolean
- error: string or null
- refresh: () => void

Behavior: calls POST /dashboard/clients with filters, sort, page, pageSize. Edge function queries clients with joins to crm_contacts (primary), wizard_sessions, wizard_answers (step count), projects (count), activities (max date), team_members (consultant). Health score computed in handler.

URL sync: filters, sort column, sort direction, page, and pageSize sync to URL search params via useSearchParams from react-router. Changing any filter resets page to 1. This makes filtered views shareable via URL.

Debounce: search input debounces 300ms before updating filters.search and triggering refetch.

Refetch triggers: after createClient, updateStatus, or assignConsultant mutations.

### useClientDetail

Location: /lib/hooks/useClientDetail.ts

Purpose: fetch full profile for a single client (used by the detail panel).

Input: clientId (string or null), accessToken.

Returns:
- client: ClientDetail or null (all fields plus contacts array, projects array, readiness score)
- activities: ActivityItem[] (last 20 engagement events)
- loading: boolean
- error: string or null

Behavior: when clientId is non-null, calls POST /dashboard/clients/:id. Returns full client with all crm_contacts, all projects, recent activities, wizard progress, and readiness score. When clientId is null, returns null (panel closed).

### useClientMutations

Location: /lib/hooks/useClientMutations.ts

Purpose: create, update, assign, and export clients.

Returns:
- createClient(input): inserts into clients + crm_contacts, returns new ClientListItem
- updateStatus(clientIds[], status): bulk update via PUT /dashboard/clients/status
- assignConsultant(clientIds[], consultantId): bulk assign via PUT /dashboard/clients/assign
- exportCSV(clientIds[]): calls POST /dashboard/clients/export, returns Blob for download
- isLoading: boolean

Each mutation calls refresh on useClients after success.

### API Layer Additions (lib/supabase.ts)

clientApi module:
- list(filters, sort, pagination, token): POST /dashboard/clients
- detail(clientId, token): POST /dashboard/clients/:id
- create(input, token): POST /dashboard/clients/create
- updateStatus(clientIds, status, token): PUT /dashboard/clients/status
- assignConsultant(clientIds, consultantId, token): PUT /dashboard/clients/assign
- exportCSV(clientIds, token): POST /dashboard/clients/export

### Edge Function Routes (new file: client-routes.tsx)

POST /dashboard/clients: paginated list with filters. Joins clients, crm_contacts, wizard_sessions, wizard_answers, projects, activities, team_members. Computes health score per client. Returns clients array plus total count plus filter option values.

POST /dashboard/clients/:id: single client detail. All contacts, all projects, recent 20 activities, wizard progress, readiness score from step 4.

POST /dashboard/clients/create: insert into clients, optionally insert into crm_contacts with is_primary true. Returns new client.

PUT /dashboard/clients/status: batch update clients.status where id in array. Returns count updated.

PUT /dashboard/clients/assign: batch update clients.assigned_consultant_id where id in array. Returns count updated.

POST /dashboard/clients/export: query selected clients with all fields, format as CSV string, return with Content-Type text/csv.

POST /dashboard/clients/health: recompute health scores for specified clients (or all). Health formula: activity_frequency * 0.3 + wizard_completion * 0.3 + milestone_completion * 0.2 + recency * 0.2.

### MVP Without Tables

Before clients and crm_contacts tables exist, derive client data from wizard_sessions. Each session with a unique user_id becomes a virtual "client." Company name from step 1 answers.companyName. Industry from step 1 answers.industry. Wizard progress from step completion. No contacts, no consultant assignment, no bulk actions. Read-only list with progress indicators.

---

## PROJECT DELIVERY HOOKS & WIRING

### useProject

Location: /lib/hooks/useProject.ts

Purpose: fetch project metadata, phases, and selected systems for the project detail page.

Input: projectId (or sessionId for MVP), accessToken.

Returns:
- project: { name, clientName, status, totalWeeks, investment, overallProgress }
- phases: { phaseNumber, title, weekRange, systems, progress, status, deliverables, milestones }[]
- selectedSystems: { id, name, description }[]
- quickWins: string[]
- riskFactors: { risk, mitigation }[]
- successMetrics: { metric, target, timeframe }[]
- loading: boolean
- error: string or null

MVP behavior: calls wizardApi.load(sessionId) and parses step 5 ai_results.roadmap into typed project state. Systems from step 3 selections mapped to AI_SYSTEMS static data. Phase progress calculated from task statuses (from useProjectTasks).

Future behavior: calls GET /projects/:id which returns project with phases, systems, milestones from proper tables.

### useProjectTasks

Location: /lib/hooks/useProjectTasks.ts

Purpose: manage tasks per phase with status toggling and creation.

Input: sessionId, phases (from useProject).

Returns:
- tasksByPhase: Record of phaseNumber to { id, title, status, priority, assigneeId, dueDate }[]
- tasksByStatus: (phaseNumber) => { todo, inProgress, review, done } grouped arrays
- moveTask: (taskId, newStatus) => void — optimistic update + persist
- createTask: (phaseNumber, title, priority, assigneeId) => void
- updateTask: (taskId, updates) => void
- phaseProgress: (phaseNumber) => { completed, total, percentage }
- loading: boolean

MVP behavior: tasks derived from deliverables arrays in roadmap phases. Each deliverable string becomes a task with a generated ID (sessionId-phase-index). Status stored in localStorage keyed by task ID. moveTask updates localStorage and recalculates phase progress. createTask adds to localStorage. No server persistence.

Future behavior: tasks read from tasks table via GET /projects/:id/tasks. moveTask calls PATCH /tasks/:id. createTask calls POST /tasks. Optimistic update with rollback on error. Activity logged on every status change.

### useMilestones

Location: /lib/hooks/useMilestones.ts

Purpose: manage milestones and deliverable checklists.

Input: sessionId, phases (from useProject).

Returns:
- milestones: { id, title, dueDate, status, phaseNumber, deliverables: { id, title, completed }[] }[]
- toggleDeliverable: (milestoneId, deliverableId) => void
- milestoneStatus: (milestoneId) => upcoming | at-risk | completed | overdue
- loading: boolean

MVP behavior: milestones derived from phases[n].milestones arrays. Deliverables derived from a subset of phase deliverables associated with each milestone. Due dates derived from phase week ranges. Completion states stored in localStorage.

At-risk logic: if days until due date < 3 AND has uncompleted deliverables, status = at-risk. If current date > due date AND not all deliverables completed, status = overdue.

Future behavior: milestones and deliverables read from tables. toggleDeliverable calls PATCH /deliverables/:id. Auto-phase-advancement triggered server-side when all milestones complete.

### useTeam

Location: /lib/hooks/useTeam.ts

Purpose: fetch team members assigned to a project with workload data.

Input: orgId, projectId, accessToken.

Returns:
- members: { id, name, role, avatarUrl, taskCount, assignedTasks: string[] }[]
- loading: boolean

MVP behavior: returns empty array (no team_members table). Team avatar row hidden until data available.

Future behavior: queries team_members where org_id, counts tasks per member from tasks table.

### API Layer Additions (lib/supabase.ts)

projectApi module:
