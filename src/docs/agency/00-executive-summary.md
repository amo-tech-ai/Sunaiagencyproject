## What We Are Building

Sun AI Agency gets an AI agent layer. Instead of one generic AI generating recommendations, each client gets a curated team of specialist AI agents matched to their industry, goals, and company size.

The integration touches 3 areas:

```
WIZARD (enhance)          DASHBOARD (enhance)         NEW SCREENS (build)
  Step 3: smarter recs      Agent Team widget           Agent Catalog
  Step 4: agent proposal    Agent-powered insights      Agent Detail
  Step 5: team reveal       CRM deal scoring            Agent Runner
                            Workflow agent nodes
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No new wizard steps** — Steps 3, 4, and 5 are enhanced with agent content; the user flow stays the same
2. **Auto-assignment** — The wizard selects agents for the client; no manual team-building UI
3. **Agents are visible but not configurable** — Clients see their team but don't pick individual agents (avoids decision fatigue)
4. **Agent Runner is agency-side** — Only agency users run agents directly; clients see outputs
5. **Existing pages first** — Enhance dashboard, insights, CRM before building new catalog/detail pages

## Technical Integration Points

| System | Integration |
|---|---|
| **Wizard Context** | `step3.agentRecommendations`, `step4.assignedTeam`, `step5.teamReveal` — new fields on existing WizardState |
| **Edge Functions** | New routes: `POST /agents/match`, `POST /agents/run`, `GET /agents/catalog`, `GET /agents/:slug` |
| **KV Store** | Agent definitions stored as `agent:{division}:{slug}` keys |
| **Gemini API** | Agent-specific system prompts injected per agent role |
| **Dashboard API** | `GET /dashboard/agent-team` returns assigned agents for a project |
| **CRM API** | `GET /crm/deals/:id/score` returns agent-generated deal health score |
