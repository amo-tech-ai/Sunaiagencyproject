## KEY SUPERSIDE LAYOUT PATTERNS TO REPLICATE

1. **Alternating dark/light sections** — never two dark or two light in a row
2. **Sticky left column + scrolling right** — used for features and benefits
3. **Italic colored words in headlines** — "built to *grow*", "move *fast*"
4. **Full-bleed image blocks** that break out of the grid
5. **Horizontal service pill navigation** below the hero (scrollable on mobile)
6. **Editorial metrics band** — large numbers on dark background, always 3 stats
7. **Card grids with consistent padding** — never cramped, always 28–32px internal padding
8. **Hairline rules everywhere** — separating rows, sections, columns
9. **Subtle hover behaviors** — cards lift 2–3px, accent bars appear, icons change color
10. **Closing CTA always dark** with the brand's most memorable line
