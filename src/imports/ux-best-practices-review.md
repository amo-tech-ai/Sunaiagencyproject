**Short answer:**
Yes — your prompt already follows **many good UX practices**, but it can be **improved to be more mobile-first, implementation-ready, and responsive-system driven**.

Right now it is **~80–85% aligned with best practices**. The main gap is that it is **desktop-first instead of mobile-first**, and some responsive rules are **described but not structured enough for design systems or dev handoff**.

Below is a clear breakdown.

---

# 1. What your prompt already does well (Best Practices ✅)

### 1️⃣ Clear layout hierarchy

You defined:

* **Left panel:** progress
* **Center panel:** form
* **Right panel:** guidance

This is excellent for desktop because it separates:

```
navigation
interaction
guidance
```

This pattern is used by:

* Stripe dashboards
* Linear onboarding
* Notion AI flows

---

### 2️⃣ Good responsive breakpoints

You already defined:

| Device  | Layout        |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Mobile  | single column |
| Tablet  | 2 column      |
| Desktop | 3 panel       |

This is the correct progressive structure.

---

### 3️⃣ Good progressive disclosure

Example:

* Right panel collapses on mobile
* Website analysis loads asynchronously
* Continue button disabled until valid

This reduces cognitive load — important for wizard UX.

---

### 4️⃣ Strong whitespace rules

You defined:

```
24px spacing
large typography
max 640px form width
```

This prevents form fatigue.

---

### 5️⃣ Proper form UX

You included:

* helper text
* placeholder examples
* character count
* inline validation
* autosave

These are **excellent form best practices**.

---

# 2. Where the prompt can improve (Important ⚠️)

## 1️⃣ It is desktop-first instead of mobile-first

Your prompt starts with:

```
Desktop 1440px
Three panel layout
```

Best practice today:

```
Design mobile first
expand to tablet
expand to desktop
```

Why:

* 60–80% onboarding happens on mobile
* easier layout scaling
* better dev implementation

---

## 2️⃣ Breakpoints are not systemized

You defined only rough breakpoints.

Better practice:

| Breakpoint | Width     | Layout             |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Mobile     | 320–640   | single column      |
| Tablet     | 641–1024  | 2 column           |
| Desktop    | 1025–1440 | 3 panel            |
| Large      | 1440+     | centered container |

This helps dev implementation.

---

## 3️⃣ Panels are not defined as responsive components

Your panels should be defined like:

```
Component: WizardLayout

Mobile
Progress bar top
Form
Help accordion

Tablet
Form
Help drawer

Desktop
Progress sidebar
Form
Help sidebar
```

Right now it's described but not **systematically defined**.

---

## 4️⃣ Button behavior needs mobile rules

Example improvement:

Mobile best practices:

```
Continue button
full width
sticky bottom
48–56px height
```

Your prompt mentions sticky but not consistent spacing rules.

---

## 5️⃣ Industry selector grid not optimized for mobile

You specified:

```
3 column grid
```

Better responsive rule:

| Device  | Columns |
| ------- | ------- |
| Mobile  | 2       |
| Tablet  | 3       |
| Desktop | 3–4     |

---

## 6️⃣ Right panel needs mobile replacement pattern

You correctly hide it on mobile.

But best practice is:

```
? help button
opens bottom sheet
```

This keeps help accessible.

---

# 3. What a best-practice responsive wizard should look like

### Mobile (375px)

```
Top bar
Step 1 of 5

Form
Company name
Website
Industry
Size
Goal
Challenge

Help accordion

Continue button
(sticky bottom)
```

---

### Tablet (768px)

```
Top bar

Form column
Help drawer button
```

Help appears as slide-over.

---

### Desktop (1440px)

```
Sidebar
Form
Help panel
```

Exactly like your design.

---

# 4. Additional UX improvements (high value)

### 1️⃣ Field grouping

Group the form into sections.

Example:

```
Business Basics
Company name
Website
Industry
Size

Strategy
Goal
Challenge

Additional Context
Documents
```

Improves scanning.

---

### 2️⃣ Step completion indicator

Instead of only dots, show:

```
✔ Completed
● Current
○ Upcoming
```

---

### 3️⃣ Website analysis progress

Instead of static loading:

```
Analyzing website
✔ Reading site
✔ Market signals
✔ AI opportunities
```

Feels intelligent.

---

### 4️⃣ Mobile progress indicator

Replace vertical stepper with:

```
● ○ ○ ○ ○
Step 1 of 5
```

---

# 5. Small design system improvements

Define tokens for dev handoff.

Example:

```
Spacing
8px base grid

Form spacing
24px vertical

Card padding
20px

Max form width
640px

Button height
48px desktop
52px mobile
```

---

# 6. Overall assessment

| Area                | Score |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| Structure           | 9/10  |
| UX flow             | 9/10  |
| Form design         | 9/10  |
| Mobile UX           | 7/10  |
| Responsive system   | 7/10  |
| Dev handoff clarity | 7/10  |

### Overall

**8.5 / 10**

Very strong prompt already.

Just needs:

* mobile-first logic
* component system
* clearer breakpoints
* better help panel pattern

---

# 7. One critical UX insight

Your wizard is **excellent for consulting positioning**.

The right panel acts like:

```
AI consultant guidance
```

That is **much better than normal onboarding forms**.

This is similar to:

* Stripe Atlas
* Linear onboarding
* Clay AI setup

---

# Short summary

Your prompt is **high quality and near production ready**, but to reach best-practice UX:

Improve:

1. mobile-first structure
2. standardized breakpoints
3. component-based panels
4. mobile grid rules
5. help drawer pattern

Doing this will make the wizard **fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop**.

---

If you want, I can also show you something very useful:

**The ideal AI SaaS onboarding wizard layout used by companies like Stripe, Vercel, and Linear.**

It will make your **Sun AI wizard feel world-class.**
