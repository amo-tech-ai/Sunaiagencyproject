# Dashboard Enhancements — Wireframes

> Figma Make: Design a SaaS dashboard with a left sidebar navigation (icons + labels), top header with user avatar and breadcrumbs. Main content area has a 3-column grid of metric cards at top, then a 2-column layout with "Your AI Team" widget on the left and "Latest Insights" feed on the right. Below that, a roadmap timeline. Use white cards on light gray background, subtle shadows, blue accent colors. Premium business tool aesthetic.
