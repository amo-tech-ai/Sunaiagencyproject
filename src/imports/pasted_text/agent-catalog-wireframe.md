# New Screens — Wireframes

> Figma Make: Design 3 new pages for an AI agent platform. Page 1: Agent Catalog — a grid of agent cards organized by division tabs, each card has an emoji avatar, agent name, one-line description, and division badge. Page 2: Agent Detail — a profile page with agent identity section, capabilities list, use cases, and a "Run This Agent" button. Page 3: Agent Runner — a split-pane layout with task input on the left and agent output on the right. Use consistent sidebar navigation, white cards on light gray, blue accents. Professional SaaS feel, not playful.

## Screen 1: Agent Catalog — /app/agents/catalog

**Purpose:** Browse all available AI agents organized by division. Search, filter, and discover agents relevant to your project.
