## Description

**The situation:** The wizard's 5-step AI analysis generates substantial output: business profiling (Step 1), industry diagnostics with pain points and benchmarks (Step 2), ranked system recommendations with fit scores (Step 3), a 5-dimension readiness assessment (Step 4), and a phased roadmap with timeline and investment (Step 5). All of this is stored as jsonb in `wizard_answers.ai_results` — one row per step. There is no post-wizard view to review, compare, or re-run these analyses. The client sees the results once during the wizard and never again.

**Why it matters:** The AI analysis is the core intellectual property of the platform — it is what differentiates Sun AI from a generic consulting engagement. If clients cannot revisit their analysis, share it with stakeholders, or track how their readiness evolves over time, the analysis becomes a one-time event instead of an ongoing strategic asset. Consultants need to reference the full analysis during strategy calls and proposals. Re-running analysis after Phase 1 delivery should show measurable improvement to justify continued investment.

**What already exists:** The `wizard_answers` table stores `ai_results` jsonb for steps 1-5 per session. The `wizard_sessions` table tracks session metadata and timestamps. The `ai_run_logs` table records model, tokens, duration per AI run. The `ai_cache` table enables cache-aware re-analysis. The `context_snapshots` table is designed for storing historical analysis points. All AI agents (analyze-business, generate-diagnostics, recommend-systems, scorer, generate-roadmap) exist as edge functions. Recharts is available for radar charts and bar charts. shadcn/ui provides Accordion, Tabs, Card, Badge, and Progress components.

**The build:** Create an `AIInsights` page at `/app/insights` with a vertical scroll layout organized by wizard step. A sticky section anchor nav (Step 1: Business Profile, Step 2: Diagnostics, Step 3: Recommendations, Step 4: Readiness, Step 5: Roadmap) allows quick jumps. Each section renders the AI results for that step in a purpose-built visualization: business profile card, diagnostic insight grid, ranked system list with fit scores, readiness radar chart with 5-dimension breakdown, and roadmap summary timeline. A "Re-run Analysis" button triggers fresh AI calls and compares results with the previous run. Historical snapshots (from context_snapshots) enable side-by-side comparison. AI run stats (model, tokens, duration) appear in a collapsible footer section.

**Example:** GreenLeaf Healthcare completed the wizard 6 weeks ago and has finished Phase 1 (Patient Intake Automation). The CEO opens the AI Insights page before a quarterly review. She scrolls through: Business Profile shows "Mid-size healthcare provider, 120 employees, 3 locations, high patient volume." Diagnostics highlight "appointment no-shows costing $8K/month" and "manual intake process at 45 min/patient." Recommendations rank Patient Scheduling (95 fit) and Records Digitization (88 fit) as top systems. Readiness score shows 78/100 with "Data Readiness" at 62 (weakest). She clicks "Re-run Analysis" — the system re-evaluates with updated project data. New readiness score: 84/100 with Data Readiness improved to 74. A comparison card shows: "Readiness improved +6 points. Data Readiness improved +12 points after Phase 1 delivery."

---

## Rationale

**Problem:** AI analysis results from the wizard are buried in jsonb and only visible during the wizard flow. No way to review, share, compare, or re-run the analysis post-wizard.

**Solution:** A dedicated insights page that renders all 5 wizard steps' AI results as purpose-built visualizations with section navigation, re-run capability, and historical comparison.

**Impact:** Analysis becomes an ongoing strategic asset. Clients revisit insights before calls. Consultants use the insights page as the basis for proposals. Re-analysis after delivery shows measurable ROI.

---

## Screen Purpose

Deep dive into all AI-generated analysis from the wizard. Displays the full analysis chain: business analysis (Step 1) -> diagnostics (Step 2) -> system recommendations (Step 3) -> readiness assessment (Step 4) -> roadmap (Step 5). Allows re-running analyses with updated data and tracking how insights evolve over time through historical snapshots.

---

## Interaction Patterns

- Section anchor nav uses scrollspy — active section highlights as user scrolls
- Click section anchor -> smooth scroll to that section
- Expand/collapse each section independently (Accordion pattern)
- Click system card -> expand to show full "why it fits" analysis and ROI detail
- Click "Re-run Analysis" -> confirmation dialog ("This will run all 5 AI analyses. Estimated time: 30-60 seconds.") -> loading state per section with progress bar -> results replace current data, previous saved as snapshot
- Compare snapshots: toggle "Compare with previous" -> side-by-side view with green (improved) / red (declined) delta indicators
- Click dimension in radar chart -> scroll to that dimension's detail row
- Collapsible run stats section at bottom (default collapsed)
- Right-click insight card -> "Copy to clipboard" for pasting into proposals

## Example User Workflows

**Workflow 1 — Pre-call review:** Agency consultant Maria has a call with Acme Retail in 30 minutes. She opens the AI Insights page for Acme. She quickly scans the business profile ("e-commerce, 50 employees, Shopify + Zendesk stack"), then scrolls to diagnostics where the top pain point is "Cart abandonment at 68%, 12 points above industry average." She notes the top 3 recommended systems and their fit scores. She checks the readiness radar — "Data Readiness" at 62 is the weakest dimension. She has everything she needs for the call. Total review time: 3 minutes.

**Workflow 2 — Post-delivery re-analysis:** GreenLeaf Healthcare completed Phase 1 (Patient Intake Automation) two months ago. The consultant clicks "Re-run Analysis." The system runs all 5 AI agents with current project data. Results appear section by section over 45 seconds. Previous snapshot is auto-saved. The comparison view shows: overall readiness 78 -> 84 (+6), Data Readiness 62 -> 74 (+12), Process Maturity 75 -> 81 (+6). Two new opportunities appear in diagnostics that were not present before: "Telemedicine scheduling integration" and "Automated follow-up reminders." The consultant shares this comparison with the client as proof of Phase 1 ROI.

**Workflow 3 — Stakeholder presentation:** The Acme Retail CEO needs to present the AI transformation plan to the board. She opens AI Insights and walks through each section: business profile for context, diagnostics showing $180K/year in addressable pain points, system recommendations ranked by fit, readiness score showing the company is "moderately ready" at 72, and the 3-phase roadmap with $48K total investment and projected $290K annual return. She screenshots each section for the board deck.

---

## AI Features

- Trend detection across snapshots: "Your readiness score has improved 8 points across 3 analyses over 4 months"
- Automated insight summaries: AI generates a 2-3 sentence summary per section ("Your top operational pain point is manual ticket triage at 40 hours/week. The recommended Support Engine addresses this directly.")
- "What improved" highlights after re-analysis: green badges on dimensions and metrics that improved, with explanatory text
- Proactive recommendations based on gaps: "Your Data Readiness score of 62 is your biggest barrier. Consider a data audit before starting Phase 2."
- Cross-client pattern matching (agency view): "Clients in e-commerce with similar profiles typically improve readiness by 15 points after Phase 1"

## Data Sources (tables)

| Data | Table | Column/Query |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Business profile | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 1 |
| Diagnostics | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 2 |
| System recommendations | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 3 |
| Readiness assessment | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 4 |
| Roadmap | wizard_answers | ai_results where step_number = 5 |
| Session metadata | wizard_sessions | id, created_at, updated_at, status |
| AI run details | ai_run_logs | model, tokens_used, duration_ms, success, where session_id matches |
| Cache status | ai_cache | input_hash lookups for cache hit indication |
| Historical snapshots | context_snapshots | where session_id or org_id, ordered by created_at |
| Current org | organizations | name, industry for header context |

---

## Automation Opportunities

- Auto-save snapshot to context_snapshots before every re-analysis (preserve history)
- Trigger re-analysis suggestion when a major project milestone completes ("Phase 1 done — re-run to see updated readiness?")
- Generate executive summary PDF from insights data (all 5 sections formatted for print/share)
- Auto-notify client when re-analysis shows improvement: "Your readiness score improved to 84 after Phase 1!"
- Cache-aware re-analysis: skip unchanged sections (if business profile hasn't changed, use cached Step 1)
- Weekly digest for agency: "3 clients have not had analysis re-run in 60+ days — consider prompting re-evaluation"

---

## Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary focus**: Readiness score + business profile (top hero area, largest cards, immediate context)
2. **Secondary**: Diagnostics grid + system recommendations (middle, data-rich, scrollable)
3. **Tertiary**: Roadmap summary (bottom of main content, actionable next steps)
4. **Supporting**: Section anchor nav (sticky, navigational), Run stats (footer, metadata for technical users)

| Wizard insights data (all 5 steps) | `useWizardInsights` hook (useState) | Fetched once on mount, refetched on re-run |
| Active section (scrollspy) | `SectionAnchorNav` local useState | Only needed for nav highlighting |
| Re-run progress | `useReRunAnalysis` hook (useState) | Tracks multi-step re-analysis |
| Comparison mode on/off | `InsightsPage` local useState | Toggles SnapshotComparisonView |
| Selected snapshot for comparison | `useSnapshots` hook (useState) | Drives side-by-side view |
| Expanded system card ID | `SystemRankingList` local useState | Controls accordion expand |
| Run stats expanded/collapsed | `AIRunStats` local useState | Simple toggle |
| Session ID | URL param `?session=<id>` | Deep-linkable, read via `useSearchParams` |

### Data Fetching Pattern

```
InsightsPage mounts
  → useWizardInsights(sessionId)
      → api<WizardInsightsData>('/dashboard/insights', { method: 'POST', body: { session_id } })
      → stores response in useState, sets loading false

  → useSnapshots(sessionId)
      → api<ContextSnapshot[]>('/dashboard/insights/snapshots', { method: 'POST', body: { session_id } })

ReRunButton clicked
  → useReRunAnalysis(sessionId).reRun()
      → api('/dashboard/insights/snapshot', { method: 'POST', body: { session_id } })  // save current
      → sequential calls to 5 agents:
          api('/ai/analyze-business', ...)
          api('/ai/generate-diagnostics', ...)
          api('/ai/recommend-systems', ...)
          api('/ai/scorer', ...)
          api('/ai/generate-roadmap', ...)
      → updates progress state after each agent completes
      → calls useWizardInsights.refetch() when all done
```

### Component Communication

- **Props down**: `InsightsPage` passes `WizardInsightsData` sections to child components (e.g., `<BusinessProfileCard profile={data.business_profile} />`)
- **Callbacks up**: `ReRunButton` receives `onComplete` callback from `InsightsPage` that triggers `refetch()`
- **Scrollspy**: `SectionAnchorNav` uses `IntersectionObserver` on section elements, no shared context needed
- **Comparison mode**: `InsightsPage` holds `showComparison` state, passes `activeComparison` snapshot data to `SnapshotComparisonView` and `DimensionRow` (which renders delta indicators)
- **No global context needed**: all state is page-scoped, passed via props

## Backend Wiring

### New Edge Function Routes

| Method | Route | Handler | Request Body | Response Shape |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| POST | `/dashboard/insights` | Fetch all 5 wizard step results + run stats for a session | `{ session_id: string }` | `WizardInsightsData` |
| POST | `/dashboard/insights/snapshots` | List historical snapshots for a session | `{ session_id: string }` | `ContextSnapshot[]` |
| POST | `/dashboard/insights/snapshot` | Save current analysis as a snapshot | `{ session_id: string }` | `{ id: string, created_at: string }` |
| POST | `/dashboard/insights/rerun` | Re-run all 5 AI agents for a session (orchestrator) | `{ session_id: string }` | `{ success: boolean, steps_completed: number }` |

### Supabase Client Queries

```ts
// Fetch all wizard answers for a session (all 5 steps)
const { data: answers } = await db
  .from('wizard_answers')
  .select('step_number, ai_results, user_answers, screen_id')
  .eq('session_id', sessionId)
  .order('step_number', { ascending: true });

// Fetch AI run logs for a session
const { data: runLogs } = await db
  .from('ai_run_logs')
  .select('prompt_type, model, tokens_used, duration_ms, success, cache_hit, created_at')
  .eq('session_id', sessionId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });

// Fetch session metadata
const { data: session } = await db
  .from('wizard_sessions')
  .select('id, org_id, created_at, updated_at, status')
  .eq('id', sessionId)
  .single();

// Fetch historical snapshots
const { data: snapshots } = await db
  .from('context_snapshots')
  .select('id, created_at, snapshot_data')
  .eq('session_id', sessionId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

// Save a new snapshot before re-run
await db.from('context_snapshots').insert({
  session_id: sessionId,
  org_id: session.org_id,
  snapshot_data: {
    readiness_score: currentReadiness.overall_score,
    dimensions: currentReadiness.dimensions,
    recommendations_count: currentRecommendations.length,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
  source: 'auto',
});

// Check cache for a specific step
const { data: cached } = await db
  .from('ai_cache')
  .select('response')
  .eq('prompt_hash', inputHash)
  .gte('expires_at', new Date().toISOString())
  .single();
```

### RLS Policies Needed

| Table | Policy | Rule |
|-------|--------|------|
| `wizard_answers` | SELECT for session owner | `auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM wizard_sessions WHERE id = wizard_answers.session_id)` OR user is agency member of the org |
| `wizard_sessions` | SELECT for session owner or agency | `auth.uid() = user_id OR auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM org_members WHERE org_id = wizard_sessions.org_id)` |
| `ai_run_logs` | SELECT for agency members | `auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM org_members WHERE org_id = ai_run_logs.org_id)` |
| `context_snapshots` | SELECT/INSERT for session owner or agency | `auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM org_members WHERE org_id = context_snapshots.org_id)` |
| `ai_cache` | No direct frontend access | Accessed only via edge functions using `adminClient()` |

### API Response Interfaces

```ts
// POST /dashboard/insights response
interface InsightsResponse {
  session_id: string;
  business_profile: BusinessProfile | null;
  diagnostics: {
    pain_points: DiagnosticInsight[];
    opportunities: DiagnosticInsight[];
    benchmarks: IndustryBenchmark[];
  } | null;
  recommendations: SystemRecommendation[] | null;
  readiness: ReadinessAssessment | null;
  roadmap: {
    phases: RoadmapPhase[];
    total_investment: number;
    total_weeks: number;
  } | null;
  run_stats: AIRunMeta[];
}

// POST /dashboard/insights/snapshots response
type SnapshotsResponse = ContextSnapshot[];

// POST /dashboard/insights/snapshot response
interface SnapshotCreateResponse {
  id: string;
  created_at: string;
}

// POST /dashboard/insights/rerun response
interface ReRunResponse {
  success: boolean;
  steps_completed: number;
  errors: { step: number; message: string }[];
}
```

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| No wizard session completed | Return empty `InsightsResponse` with all fields null; frontend shows empty state: "Complete the wizard to see your AI analysis" |
| Partial wizard (e.g., only steps 1-3 done) | Return data for completed steps, null for incomplete; frontend renders completed sections, shows "Pending" badge on incomplete |
| Re-run fails mid-way (e.g., step 3 times out) | Return partial success with `steps_completed: 2` and error array; frontend shows completed steps updated, failed step with error badge and retry option |
| No snapshots exist | `snapshots` returns empty array; comparison toggle is disabled with tooltip "No previous analyses to compare" |
| Unauthorized access (wrong org) | RLS blocks query, edge function returns `{ data: null, error: "Not authorized" }` with 403 status |
| Session ID not found | Edge function returns 404 with `{ data: null, error: "Session not found" }` |
| AI cache hit on re-run | Skip the agent call for that step, use cached result; indicate cache hit in run_stats |
