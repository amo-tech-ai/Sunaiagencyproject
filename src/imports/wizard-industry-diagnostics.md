> **Right Panel (320px, white):**
> - Sticky header: "Why this matters" — serif, dark teal

>   - Q2: "Your automation maturity level determines whether we recommend foundational tools or advanced AI systems. We meet you where you are."
>   - Q3: "Support inquiries are one of the highest-ROI areas for AI. Companies with manual support processes typically see 60% cost reduction with an AI-first approach."
>   - Q4: "Your existing tools define what we integrate with versus what we replace. We never recommend rebuilding what already works."
>   - Q5: "Cart abandonment above 50% signals a high-value recovery opportunity. Automated follow-up sequences typically recover 10-15% of abandoned carts."
>   - Q6: "Post-purchase engagement drives repeat revenue. Companies with automated follow-up see 25-40% higher customer lifetime value."
>   - Q7: "Personalized recommendations increase average order value by 10-30%. This is one of the quickest AI wins in e-commerce."
>   - Q8: "High repeat revenue (>40%) means your product-market fit is strong — we focus on scaling. Low repeat revenue means we prioritize retention systems."
>
> - Below each explanation: a small "Signal" indicator showing what the system is detecting:
>   - Example: "Signal: High cart abandonment → Recovery automation recommended"
>   - Styled as a subtle callout box with left lime green border
>
> **Footer Bar:**
> - Left: "Back" text button (no fill, dark teal text, arrow left icon)
> - Center: "All changes saved" with green dot
> - Right: "Continue" button — same style as Step 1
> - Between Back and Continue: progress micro-indicator showing "5 of 8 answered"
>
> **Design Direction:**
> - Each question card should feel like a conversation — not a survey
> - Mix of input types keeps engagement high (chips, cards, slider, radio)
> - The right panel acts like a consultant sitting next to you explaining each question
> - Signals detected on the left panel give a sense of momentum and intelligence
> - Animation: when a new signal badge appears on the left panel, it should fade in with a subtle scale-up
> - When all questions are answered, the "Continue" button should get a subtle glow/pulse
> - The industry badge at the top reminds the user this is tailored to them
>
> **Responsive:**
> - Mobile: questions stack in a single column, full width cards. Right panel content appears as expandable "Why?" accordion under each question
> - Tablet: two panels (center + collapsible right drawer)
> - Desktop: full three-panel

## Workflow

```
User arrives at /app/wizard/step-2
  → Load wizard_answers for step-1 to get industry
  → Load industry-specific question bank (universal Q1-Q4 + industry Q5-Q8)
  → Load any saved step-2 answers for pre-fill

User answers questions
  → Each answer: debounce 500ms → save to wizard_answers.data
  → Left panel "Signals Detected" updates based on answer patterns:
    - e.g., cart_abandonment > 50% → add "High cart abandonment" signal
    - e.g., support = "No formal process" → add "No support structure" signal
  → Right panel "Why this matters" updates on question focus
  → Footer shows "X of 8 answered" count

User clicks "Continue"
  → Validate: all 8 questions answered (or explicitly "Don't know")
  → Save final state
  → Trigger background Edge Function: analyze_diagnostics
    - Input: step-1 + step-2 answers
    - Output: ranked system recommendations → store in ai_cache
  → Update wizard_sessions.current_step = 3
  → Navigate to step-3

User clicks "Back"
  → Navigate to step-1 (data preserved)
```

## Agent Behavior
- **No visible AI on this screen** — intelligence is passive (right panel is pre-written copy)
- **Background AI trigger on completion:** Edge Function analyzes answers after user clicks Continue
  - Runs asynchronously — user doesn't wait
  - Results cached in `ai_cache` for instant Step 3 load
  - Logged in `ai_run_logs`
- **Signal detection is rule-based, not AI:** simple conditional logic maps answers to signal badges
