>   - Company Name focused: "We use your company name to personalize your strategy brief and project dashboard."
>   - Website focused (before analysis): "If provided, our AI will analyze your online presence using URL Context and Google Search to provide more accurate recommendations."
>   - Website focused (analysis running): Shows loading skeleton with "Analyzing your website..." message
>   - Website focused (analysis complete): Shows "Company Analysis" card with extracted company description, detected industry, products/services, team size estimate, technology signals, and AI opportunity indicators
>   - Industry focused: "Your industry determines which diagnostic questions we ask next. Each industry has unique challenges and automation opportunities."

> **Footer Bar (full width, white, subtle top border):**
> - Left side: nothing (this is step 1, no back button)
> - Center: auto-save status — small text "All changes saved" with green dot
> - Right side: "Continue" button — dark teal background, white text, 8px radius, disabled until required fields are filled. On hover: slightly lighter teal.
>
> **Design Direction:**
> - Premium, editorial feel — think Stripe's documentation meets a luxury hotel's booking flow
> - Typography-led hierarchy — Playfair Display for the heading, Lora for body, clean sans-serif for labels
> - Warm neutral palette — beige background, white cards, dark teal text, lime green accents only for active/selected states
> - No gradients, no shadows on form fields, no decorative elements
> - Strong visual hierarchy through spacing and type size, not decoration
> - Generous whitespace — the form should breathe, never feel cramped
> - The industry selector should feel like browsing a curated catalog, not filling out a government form
>
> **Responsive:**
> - Mobile (375px): single column, left panel becomes a horizontal step indicator at top (dots only), right panel hidden behind a "?" floating button that opens a bottom sheet
> - Tablet (768px): two columns — center + right panel as a slide-over drawer triggered by "?" icon
> - Desktop (1440px): full three-panel layout as described

## Workflow

1. **User arrives at /app/wizard/step-1**
   - Check wizard_sessions for existing session
   - If a session exists: pre-fill form from wizard_answers
   - If no session exists: create a new wizard_session with current_step set to 1

2. **User fills fields**
   - Each field change is debounced by 500ms, then saved to wizard_answers.data (JSONB)
   - Left panel context card updates in real-time as fields are filled
   - Right panel content changes based on which field is focused

3. **User enters website URL (triggers AI analysis)**
   - On blur of URL field (if valid URL): call analyze-business Edge Function
   - Edge Function uses Gemini with both URL Context and Google Search tools enabled
   - URL Context reads the website content (HTML, images, PDFs up to 34MB)
   - Google Search finds market context, competitors, news, and industry data
   - Results cached in ai_cache (keyed by URL + session_id)
   - Right panel updates with "Company Analysis" card showing extracted insights
   - If analysis detects industry or company size, offer to auto-fill Fields 3 and 4
   - If URL is invalid or fails: show static right panel guidance, no error shown to user

4. **User uploads documents**
   - Upload file to Supabase Storage (bucket: 'wizard-documents')
   - Create a documents row with category 'Wizard-Context' and the wizard_session_id
   - Show upload progress indicator, then display filename and size in the file list

5. **User clicks "Continue"**
   - Validate required fields: company name, industry, size, goal, challenge
   - If valid: update wizard_sessions.current_step to 2, navigate to step-2
   - If invalid: show inline errors on missing fields and scroll to the first error

---

## Agent Behavior

### URL Context Analysis (triggered by website URL field)

When the user enters a website URL in Field 2, the `analyze-business` Edge Function is triggered using two Gemini tools working together in a single API call.

---

### Tool 1 — URL Context (`{urlContext: {}}`)

Gemini ingests and reasons over the full content of the provided URL. This is not a simple scrape — the model reads the page like a human would, understanding layout, navigation, product offerings, pricing, team info, and brand positioning.

**Supported content types:**
- Text: HTML, JSON, plain text, XML, CSS, JavaScript, CSV, RTF
- Images: PNG, JPEG, BMP, WebP
- Documents: PDF

**Limits:**
- Up to **20 URLs** per request
- Up to **34MB** per URL
- URLs must be publicly accessible (no login walls, paywalls, localhost, private networks, or tunneling services like ngrok)

**Not supported:** YouTube videos, Google Workspace files (Docs, Sheets), video/audio files, paywalled content.

**Retrieval mechanism:** Two-stage — attempts internal index cache first, then falls back to live fetching.

**Response metadata:** The response includes `url_context_metadata` with per-URL retrieval status:
```json
{
  "url_context_metadata": {
    "url_metadata": [
      {
        "retrieved_url": "https://example.com",
        "url_retrieval_status": "URL_RETRIEVAL_STATUS_SUCCESS"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Status values: `URL_RETRIEVAL_STATUS_SUCCESS`, `URL_RETRIEVAL_STATUS_UNSAFE` (failed moderation).

**Token billing:** Retrieved content counts toward input tokens in `usage_metadata`. Billed at standard per-token rates for the model.

**SDK usage (TypeScript — Deno edge function):**
```typescript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: Deno.env.get("GEMINI_API_KEY") });

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents: "Analyze this company website and extract business context: https://example.com",
  config: {
    tools: [{ urlContext: {} }],
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseSchema: companyAnalysisSchema,
  },
});
```

---

### Tool 2 — Google Search (`{googleSearch: {}}`)

Gemini automatically generates and executes search queries based on the company name and URL to discover additional context — competitor landscape, industry positioning, recent news, company size estimates, technology stack, and market trends. The model decides which searches to run and how many.

**Billing:** Per search query executed (Gemini 3 models). Multiple searches within one API call count as multiple billable queries. Empty queries are excluded.

**Response metadata:** The response includes `groundingMetadata` with three key structures:

```json
{
  "groundingMetadata": {
    "webSearchQueries": ["Acme Corp AI consulting", "Acme Corp competitors"],
    "groundingChunks": [
      { "web": { "uri": "https://source.com/article", "title": "Source Title" } }
    ],
    "groundingSupports": [
      {
        "segment": { "startIndex": 0, "endIndex": 85 },
        "groundingChunkIndices": [0]
      }
    ],
    "searchEntryPoint": {
      "renderedContent": "<style>...</style><div>...</div>"
    }
  }
}
```

- **`webSearchQueries`** — Array of search queries the model executed (useful for debugging/logging)
- **`groundingChunks`** — Array of web sources with `uri` and `title` for attribution
- **`groundingSupports`** — Maps text segments (`startIndex`/`endIndex`) to source chunks via `groundingChunkIndices`
- **`searchEntryPoint`** — HTML/CSS for rendering required Search Suggestions (Terms of Service compliance)

**SDK usage (TypeScript — Deno edge function):**
```typescript
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents: "Research Acme Corp: market position, competitors, industry trends",
  config: {
    tools: [{ googleSearch: {} }],
  },
});

// Access grounding metadata
const metadata = response.candidates[0]?.groundingMetadata;
const sources = metadata?.groundingChunks?.map(c => c.web) ?? [];
const queries = metadata?.webSearchQueries ?? [];
```

---

### Combined Tool Usage (analyze-business Edge Function)

Both tools are passed together in a single Gemini API call. The model uses URL Context for deep website analysis and Google Search for broad market intelligence.

**Edge Function configuration:**
```typescript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: Deno.env.get("GEMINI_API_KEY") });

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents: `Analyze this business website and research market context.
    Website: ${websiteUrl}
    Company: ${companyName}

    Extract: company description, industry, products/services, team size estimate,
    technology signals, competitive positioning, and AI opportunity indicators.`,
  config: {
    tools: [
      { urlContext: {} },
      { googleSearch: {} },
    ],
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        company_description: { type: "string" },
        detected_industry: { type: "string" },
        products_services: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
        team_size_estimate: { type: "string", enum: ["small", "medium", "large", "enterprise"] },
        technology_signals: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
        competitive_positioning: { type: "string" },
        ai_opportunities: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
        confidence_score: { type: "number" },
        sources: {
          type: "array",
          items: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              url: { type: "string" },
              title: { type: "string" },
            },
          },
        },
      },
      required: ["company_description", "detected_industry", "products_services",
                  "team_size_estimate", "ai_opportunities", "confidence_score"],
    },
  },
});

// Parse structured response
const analysis = JSON.parse(response.text);

// Extract grounding sources for attribution
const groundingChunks = response.candidates?.[0]?.groundingMetadata?.groundingChunks ?? [];
const urlMetadata = response.candidates?.[0]?.urlContextMetadata?.urlMetadata ?? [];
```

**Important limitations when combining tools:**
- Function calling (user-defined functions) is **not supported** alongside URL Context
- URL Context is only available via Gemini API, not Vertex AI
- The model only retrieves from specified URLs — it does not follow nested links

---

### Trigger Behavior

- Fires after the URL field loses focus (on blur) AND the URL is valid (starts with http/https)
- Debounced — if user edits the URL, previous request is cancelled via `AbortController`
- Results populate the right panel with a "Company Analysis" card showing extracted insights
- Analysis runs in the background — does not block form completion
- If URL Context fails (private page, timeout), falls back to Google Search only
- If both fail, right panel shows static guidance (graceful degradation)

### Caching Strategy

- Results cached in `ai_cache` keyed by `(org_id, "analyze-business", hash(url + session_id))`
- Cache TTL: 24 hours (business websites don't change frequently)
- On cache hit: return cached result immediately, skip Gemini API call
- On cache miss: call Gemini, then store result in ai_cache

### Right Panel Updates When Analysis Completes

- Company description (extracted from website via URL Context)
- Industry classification (auto-detected, can pre-fill Field 3)
- Products/services identified
- Team size estimate (can pre-fill Field 4)
- Technology signals detected
- Competitive positioning (from Google Search grounding)
- AI opportunity indicators (early signals for Step 2)
- Source attribution links (from `groundingChunks`)

### What is NOT AI-generated on this screen

- Right panel guidance text for non-URL fields remains static (pre-written copy)
- Auto-save runs silently — no loading spinners, just the status indicator
- If user returns to this step later, all fields are pre-filled from saved data and cached analysis is restored from ai_cache
